	abstract = {The supergiant ionized shell SMC-SGS 1 (DEM 167), located in the outer Wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), resembles structures that originate from an energetic star-formation event and later stimulate star formation as they expand into the ambient medium. However, stellar populations within and surrounding SMC-SGS 1 tell a different story. We present a photometric study of the stellar population encompassed by SMC-SGS 1 in order to trace the history of this structure and its potential influence on star formation within the low-density, low-metallicity SMC Wing. For a stellar population that is physically associated with SMC-SGS 1, we combined near-ultraviolet (NUV) photometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) with archival optical (V-band) photometry from the ESO Danish 1.54m Telescope. Given their colors and luminosities, we estimated stellar ages and masses by matching observed photometry to theoretical stellar isochrone models. We find that the investigated region supports an active, extended star-formation event spanning \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 25 - 40 Myr ago, as well as continued star formation into the present. Using a standard initial mass function (IMF), we infer a lower bound on the stellar mass from this period of \${\textbackslash}sim 3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}4 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, corresponding to a star-formation intensity of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 6 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. The spatial and temporal distributions of young stars encompassed by SMC-SGS 1 imply a slow, consistent progression of star formation over millions of years. Ongoing star formation along the edge of and interior to SMC-SGS 1 suggests a combined stimulated and stochastic mode of star formation within the SMC Wing. A slow expansion of the shell within this low-density environment may preserve molecular clouds within the volume of the shell, leaving them to form stars even after nearby stellar feedback expels local gas and dust.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08895},
	abstract = {One of the high-level goals of Galactic archaeology is chemical tagging of stars across the Milky Way to piece together its assembly history. For this to work, stars born together must be uniquely chemically homogeneous. Wide binary systems are an important laboratory to test this underlying assumption. Here we present the detailed chemical abundance patterns of 50 stars across 25 wide binary systems comprised of main-sequence stars of similar spectral type identified in Gaia DR2 with the aim of quantifying their level of chemical homogeneity. Using high-resolution spectra obtained with McDonald Observatory, we derive stellar atmospheric parameters and precise detailed chemical abundances for light/odd-Z (Li, C, Na, Al, Sc, V, Cu), \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ (Mg, Si, Ca), Fe-peak (Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn), and neutron capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu) elements. Results indicate that 80\% (20 pairs) of the systems are homogeneous in [Fe/H] at levels below 0.02 dex. These systems are also chemically homogeneous in all elemental abundances studied, with offsets and dispersions consistent with measurement uncertainties. We also find that wide binary systems are far more chemically homogeneous than random pairings of field stars of similar spectral type. These results indicate that wide binary systems tend to be chemically homogeneous but in some cases they can differ in their detailed elemental abundances at a level of [X/H] {\textasciitilde} 0.10 dex, overall implying chemical tagging in broad strokes can work.},

The atmospheric parameters and metallicities are derived from spectral syntheses with 1-D LTE plane parallel MARCS models and the APOGEE atomic/molecular line list, together with up-to-date H\$\_\{2\}\$O and FeH molecular line lists. Our sample range in \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ from \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 3200 to 3800K, where eleven stars are in binary systems with a warmer (FGK) primary, while the other 10 M-dwarfs have interferometric radii in the literature. We define an \$M\_\{K\_\{S\}\}\$--Radius calibration based on our M-dwarf radii derived from the detailed analysis of APOGEE spectra and Gaia DR2 distances, as well as a mass-radius relation using the spectroscopically-derived surface gravities. A comparison of the derived radii with interferometric values from the literature finds that the spectroscopic radii are slightly offset towards smaller values, with \${\textbackslash}Delta\$ = -0.01 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.02 \$R\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$/\$R\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. In addition, the derived M-dwarf masses based upon the radii and surface gravities tend to be slightly smaller (by \${\textbackslash}sim\$5-10{\textbackslash}\%) than masses derived for M-dwarf members of eclipsing binary systems for a given stellar radius. The metallicities derived for the 11 M-dwarfs in binary systems, compared to metallicities obtained for their hotter FGK main-sequence primary stars from the literature, shows excellent agreement, with a mean difference of [Fe/H](M-dwarf - FGK primary) = +0.04 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.18 dex, confirming the APOGEE metallicity scale derived here for M-dwarfs.},

	abstract = {Despite the fact that they do not consider the temporal nature of data, classic dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, are widely applied to time series data. In this paper, we introduce a factor decomposition specific for time series that builds upon the Bayesian multivariate autoregressive model and hence evades the assumption that data points are mutually independent. The key is to find a low-rank estimation of the autoregressive matrices. As in the probabilistic version of other factor models, this induces a latent low-dimensional representation of the original data. We discuss some possible generalisations and alternatives, with the most relevant being a technique for simultaneous smoothing and dimensionality reduction. To illustrate the potential applications, we apply the model on a synthetic data set and different types of neuroimaging data (EEG and ECoG).},

	abstract = {We use a homogeneous catalog of 42,000 main-sequence wide binaries identified by Gaia to measure the mass ratio distribution, p(q), of binaries with primary masses \$0.1{\textless}M\_1/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textless}2.5\$, mass ratios \$0.1 {\textbackslash}lesssim q{\textless}1\$, and separations \$50{\textless}s/\{{\textbackslash}rm AU\}{\textless}50,000\$. A well-understood selection function allows us to constrain p(q) in 35 independent bins of primary mass and separation, with hundreds to thousands of binaries in each bin. Our investigation reveals a sharp excess of equal-mass "twin" binaries that is statistically significant out to separations of 1,000 to 10,000 AU, depending on primary mass. The excess is narrow: a steep increase in p(q) at \$0.95 {\textbackslash}lesssim q{\textless}1\$, with no significant excess at \$q{\textbackslash}lesssim 0.95\$. A range of tests confirm the signal is real, not a data artifact or selection effect. Combining the Gaia constraints with those from close binaries, we show that the twin excess decreases with increasing separation, but its width (\$q{\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.95\$) is constant over \$0.01{\textless}a/\{{\textbackslash}rm AU\}{\textless}10,000\$. The wide twin population would be difficult to explain if the components of all wide binaries formed via core fragmentation, which is not expected to produce strongly correlated component masses. We conjecture that wide twins formed at closer separations (\$a {\textbackslash}lesssim 100\$ AU), likely via accretion from circumbinary disks, and were subsequently widened by dynamical interactions in their birth environments. The separation-dependence of the twin excess then constrains the efficiency of dynamical widening and disruption of binaries in young clusters. We also constrain p(q) across \$0.1 {\textbackslash}lesssim q{\textless}1\$. Besides changes in the twin fraction, p(q) is independent of separation at fixed primary mass over \$100 {\textbackslash}lesssim s/\{{\textbackslash}rm AU\} {\textless} 50,000\$. It is flatter than expected for random pairings from the IMF but more bottom-heavy for wide binaries than for binaries with \$a{\textbackslash}lesssim\$100 AU.},

nearly 400 WD/WD binaries with projected separations of 50 ≲ s/\{au\}
{\textless} 50 000. Accounting for incompleteness and selection effects, we
model the separation distribution of each class of binaries as a broken
power law, revealing marked differences between the three populations.
The separation distribution of MS/MS systems is nearly consistent with a
single power law of slope -1.6 over at least 500 {\textless} s/au {\textless} 50 000,
with marginal steepening at s {\textgreater} 10 000au. In contrast, the separation
distributions of WD/MS and WD/WD binaries show distinct breaks at
˜3000 and ˜1500 au, respectively: they are flatter than the
MS/MS distribution at small separations and steeper at large
separations. Using binary population synthesis models, we show that
these breaks are unlikely to be caused by external factors but can be
explained if the WDs incur a kick of ˜0.75 km s-1
during their formation, presumably due to asymmetric mass-loss. The data
rule out typical kick velocities above 2 km s-1. Our results
imply that most wide binaries with separations exceeding a few thousand
au become unbound during post-MS evolution.},

	abstract = {With the coming data deluge from synoptic surveys, there is a growing need for frameworks that can quickly and automatically produce calibrated classification probabilities for newly-observed variables based on a small number of time-series measurements. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for variable-star classification, drawing from modern machine-learning techniques. We describe how to homogenize the information gleaned from light curves by selection and computation of real-numbered metrics ("feature"), detail methods to robustly estimate periodic light-curve features, introduce tree-ensemble methods for accurate variable star classification, and show how to rigorously evaluate the classification results using cross validation. On a 25-class data set of 1542 well-studied variable stars, we achieve a 22.8\% overall classification error using the random forest classifier; this represents a 24\% improvement over the best previous classifier on these data. This methodology is effective for identifying samples of specific science classes: for pulsational variables used in Milky Way tomography we obtain a discovery efficiency of 98.2\% and for eclipsing systems we find an efficiency of 99.1\%, both at 95\% purity. We show that the random forest (RF) classifier is superior to other machine-learned methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and relative immunity to features with no useful class information; the RF classifier can also be used to estimate the importance of each feature in classification. Additionally, we present the first astronomical use of hierarchical classification methods to incorporate a known class taxonomy in the classifier, which further reduces the catastrophic error rate to 7.8\%. Excluding low-amplitude sources, our overall error rate improves to 14\%, with a catastrophic error rate of 3.5\%.},

	abstract = {We report on the properties of eclipsing binaries from the Kepler mission with a newly developed photometric modeling code, which uses the light curve, spectral energy distribution of each binary, and stellar evolution models to infer stellar masses without the need for radial velocity measurements. We present solutions and posteriors to orbital and stellar parameters for 728 systems, forming the largest homogeneous catalogue of full Kepler binary parameter estimates to date. Using comparisons to published radial velocity measurements, we demonstrate that the inferred properties (e.g., masses) are reliable for well-detached main-sequence binaries, which make up the majority of our sample. The fidelity of our inferred parameters degrades for a subset of systems not well described by input isochrones, such as short-period binaries that have undergone interactions, or binaries with post-main sequence components. Additionally, we identify 35 new systems which show evidence of eclipse timing variations, perhaps from apsidal motion due to binary tides or tertiary companions. We plan to subsequently use these models to search for and constrain the presence of circumbinary planets in Kepler eclipsing binary systems.},

Stellar element abundances are, however, not observed: to decipher the spectral fingerprints in terms of abundances requires realistic models for the stellar atmospheres and the line-formation processes. Still today, the vast majority of abundance analyses of late-type stars rely on one-dimensional (1D), hydrostatic model atmospheres and the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In this review possible systematic errors in studies of F-, G- and K-type stars introduced by these questionable approximations are discussed. Departures from LTE are commonplace and often quite severe, in particular for low surface gravities or metallicities, with minority species and low-excitation transitions being the most vulnerable. Recently, time-dependent, 3D, hydrodynamical model atmospheres have started to be employed for stellar abundance purposes, with large differences compared with 1D modeling found in particular for metal-poor stars. An assessment of non-LTE and 3D effects for individual elements as well as on the estimated stellar parameters is presented.},

	abstract = {The advent of large-scale spectroscopic surveys underscores the need to develop robust techniques for determining stellar properties ("labels", i.e., physical parameters and elemental abundances). However, traditional spectroscopic methods that utilize stellar models struggle to reproduce cool (\${\textbackslash}textless\$4700 K) stellar atmospheres due to an abundance of unconstrained molecular transitions, making modeling via synthetic spectral libraries difficult. Because small, cool stars such as K and M dwarfs are both common and good targets for finding small, cool planets, establishing precise spectral modeling techniques for these stars is of high priority. To address this, we apply The Cannon, a data-driven method of determining stellar labels, to Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) spectra of 141 cool (\${\textbackslash}textless\$5200 K) stars from the California Planet Search. Our implementation is capable of predicting labels for small (\${\textbackslash}textless\$1 \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}backslashodot\}\$) stars of spectral types K and later with accuracies of 68 K in effective temperature (\$T\_\{eff\}\$), 5\% in stellar radius (\$R\_\{*\}\$), and 0.08 dex in bulk metallicity ([Fe/H]), and maintains this performance at low spectral resolutions (\$R\$ \${\textbackslash}textless\$ 5000). As M-dwarfs are the focus of many future planet-detection surveys, this work can aid efforts to better characterize the cool star population and uncover correlations between cool star abundances and planet occurrence for constraining planet formation theories.},

	abstract = {The achievable level of precision on photospheric abundances of stars is a major limiting factor on investigations of exoplanet host star characteristics, the chemical histories of star clusters, and the evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies. While model-induced errors can be minimized through the differential analysis of spectrally similar stars, the maximum achievable precision of this technique has been debated. As a test, we derive differential abundances of 19 elements from high-quality asteroid-reflected solar spectra taken using a variety of instruments and conditions. We treat the solar spectra as being from unknown stars and use the resulting differential abundances, which are expected to be zero, as a diagnostic of the error in our measurements. Our results indicate that the relative resolution of the target and reference spectra is a major consideration, with use of different instruments to obtain the two spectra leading to errors up to 0.04 dex. Use of the same instrument at different epochs for the two spectra has a much smaller effect (∼0.007 dex). The asteroid used to obtain the solar standard also has a negligible effect (∼0.006 dex). Assuming that systematic errors from the stellar model atmospheres have been minimized, as in the case of solar twins, we confirm that differential chemical abundances can be obtained at sub-0.01 dex precision with due care in the observations, data reduction and abundance analysis.},

JWST's international partners are the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). JWST will address four major science themes: end of the dark ages: first light and reionization; the assembly of galaxies, the birth of stars and protoplanetary systems; and the formation of planetary systems and the origins of life. We discuss the design of the observatory and review recent progress on the JWST program. © 2008.},

One such indicator is the astrometric chi-square, or equivalently the unit weight error (UWE) being the square root of the reduced chi-square. The usefulness of the UWE is however severely hampered by its distribution having strong dependences on magnitude and colour. These dependences can be eliminated by a re-normalisation process, using tables provided with this TN. The re-normalised UWE (or RUWE) is a more reliable and informative goodness-of-fit statistic than for example the astrometric excess noise.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00159-018-0111-3},
	abstract = {Methods to determine abundances of the elements in the atmospheres of F, G, and K stars with precisions of 0.01-0.03 dex are reviewed. Such high-precision stellar abundances have led to the discovery of unexpected phenomena and relations with important bearings on the astrophysics of galaxies, stars, and planets, such as existence of discrete stellar populations in the Galactic disk and halo, differences in the relation between abundances and elemental condensation temperature for the Sun and solar twins, differences in chemical composition between binary star components and between members of star clusters, and tight relations between some abundance ratios and age for solar-like stars. We conclude that if high-precision abundances can be achieved in studies of more distant stars and stars on the giant and supergiant branches, many more interesting future applications, of great relevance to stellar and galaxy evolution, will be possible. Hence, in planning abundance surveys, it is important to carefully balance the need for large samples of stars against the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio needed to obtain high-precision abundances. Furthermore, it is an advantage to work differentially on stars with similar atmospheric parameters, because then a simple 1D LTE analysis of stellar spectra may be sufficient. However, when determining high-precision absolute abundances or differential abundances between stars having more widely different parameters, e.g. metal-poor stars compared to the Sun or giants to dwarfs, then 3D non-LTE effects must be taken into account.},

	abstract = {The Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library (STIL) is a pure-Java, open source library for I/O and manipulation of tabular data such as astronomical catalogs. It is designed to be high-performance and to cope with large tables. The core library is format-neutral, with the work of serialization and deserialization performed by pluggable format-specific I/O handlers. This means that the programmer seees a high-level abstraction of a table which is easy to work with, and also that support for new data formats can be added easily. Supplied handlers provide support for VOTables, FITS table extensions, relational databases via SQL and plain text tables, amongst others. The VOTable handler is believed to be the only existing library capable of reading or writing all the defined VOTable encoding formats (tabledata, fits, binary). TOPCAT, based on STIL, is a user-friendly graphical program for viewing, analysis and editing of tables. It has facilities for plotting, cross matching, row selection, sorting and manipulation of data and metadata. Synthetic columns can be created and row selections made using a powerful and extensible algebraic expression language.},

The main improvements upon previous ODFs computed by Kurucz (1990) are: (1) the replacement of the solar abundances from Anders \& Grevesse (1989) with those from Grevesse \& Sauval (1998); (2) the replacement of the TiO lines provided by Kurucz (1993) with the TiO lines from Schwenke (1998), as distributed by Kurucz (1999a); (3) the addition of the H2O lines from Partridge \& Schwenke (1997) as distributed by Kurucz (1999b); (4) the addition of the HI-HI and HI-H+ quasi-molecular absorptions near 1600 A and 1400 A computed according to Allard et al. (1998). Other minor improvements are related with some changes in a few atomic and molecular data. New grids of ATLAS9 model atmospheres for Teff from 3500K to 50000K and logg from 0.0 dex to 5.0 dex have been computed for several metallicities with the new ODFs. Preliminary comparisons of the results from the old and new models have shown differences in the energy distributions of stars cooler than 4500K, in the ultraviolet energy distribution of metal-poor A-type stars, in the U-B and u-b color indices for Teff{\textless}7000K and in all the color indices for Teff{\textless}4250K.},

	abstract = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been in operation since July 2014. This paper describes the second data release from this phase, and the fourteenth from SDSS overall (making this, Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes public data taken by SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (July 2014-2016). Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS); the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data driven machine learning algorithm known as "The Cannon"; and almost twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of the publicly available data from SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS website (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release, and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020, and will be followed by SDSS-V.},

	abstract = {Binary stars make up a significant portion of all stellar systems. Consequently, an understanding of the bulk properties of binary stars is necessary for a full picture of star formation. Binary surveys indicate that both multiplicity fraction and typical orbital separation increase as functions of primary mass. Correlations with higher-order architectural parameters such as mass ratio are less well constrained. We seek to identify and characterize double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) among the 1350 M-dwarf ancillary science targets with APOGEE spectra in the SDSS-III Data Release 13. We measure the degree of asymmetry in the APOGEE pipeline cross-correlation functions (CCFs) and use those metrics to identify a sample of 44 high-likelihood candidate SB2s. At least 11 of these SB2s are known, having been previously identified by Deshpande et al. and/or El-Badry et al. We are able to extract radial velocities (RVs) for the components of 36 of these systems from their CCFs. With these RVs, we measure mass ratios for 29 SB2s and five SB3s. We use Bayesian techniques to fit maximum-likelihood (but still preliminary) orbits for four SB2s with eight or more distinct APOGEE observations. The observed (but incomplete) mass-ratio distribution of this sample rises quickly toward unity. Two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests find probabilities of 18.3\% and 18.7\%, demonstrating that the mass-ratio distribution of our sample is consistent with those measured by Pourbaix et al. and Fernandez et al., respectively.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery of four low-mass (\$M{\textless}0.6\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) eclipsing binary (EB) systems in the sub-Gyr old Praesepe open cluster using Kepler/K2 time-series photometry and Keck/HIRES spectroscopy. We present a new Gaussian process eclipsing binary model, GP-EBOP, as well as a method of simultaneously determining effective temperatures and distances for EBs. Three of the reported systems (AD 3814, AD 2615 and AD 1508) are detached and double-lined, and precise solutions are presented for the first two. We determine masses and radii to 1-3\% precision for AD 3814 and to 5-6\% for AD 2615. Together with effective temperatures determined to \${\textbackslash}sim\$50 K precision, we test the PARSEC v1.2 and BHAC15 stellar evolution models. Our EB parameters are more consistent with the PARSEC models, primarily because the BHAC15 temperature scale is hotter than our data over the mid M-dwarf mass range probed. Both ADs 3814 and 2615, which have orbital periods of 6.0 and 11.6 days, are circularized but not synchronized. This suggests that either synchronization proceeds more slowly in fully convective stars than the theory of equilibrium tides predicts or magnetic braking is currently playing a more important role than tidal forces in the spin evolution of these binaries. The fourth system (AD 3116) comprises a brown dwarf transiting a mid M-dwarf, which is the first such system discovered in a sub-Gyr open cluster. Finally, these new discoveries increase the number of characterized EBs in sub-Gyr open clusters by 20\% (40\%) below \$M{\textless}1.5\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (\$M{\textless}0.6\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$).},

We ﬁnd that the observational data and the theoretical isochrones for both blue and red HeB populations overlap in optical luminosities and colors and the observed and predicted blue to red HeB ratios agree for stars older than 50 Myr over the time bins studied. These ﬁndings conﬁrm the usefulness of applying isochrones to interpret observations of HeB populations. However, there are signiﬁcant differences, especially for the red HeB population. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd (1) offsets in color between the observations and theoretical isochrones of order 0.15 mag (0.5 mag) for the blue (red) HeB populations brighter than MV ∼ −4 mag, which cannot be solely due to differential extinction; (2) blue HeB stars fainter than MV ∼ −3 mag are bluer than predicted; (3) the slope of the red HeB sequence is shallower than predicted by a factor of ∼3; and (4) the models overpredict the ratio of the most luminous blue to red HeB stars corresponding to ages 50 Myr. Additionally, we ﬁnd that for the more metal-rich galaxies in our sample (Z 0.5 Z ), the red HeB stars overlap with the red giant branch stars in the color–magnitude diagrams, thus reducing their usefulness as indicators of star formation for ages 100 Myr.},

Eclipsing binary stars are the most valuable of these, as they are our main source of direct mass and radius measurements for normal stars. In good cases, masses and radii can be obtained to better than 1\% precision and accuracy using only photometry, spectroscopy and geometry. These measurements constitute vital empirical data aginst which theoretical models of stars can be verified and improved.

In this work we systematically characterize solar-like oscillations and granulation for 16,094 oscillating red giants, using end-of-mission long-cadence data. We produced a homogeneous catalog of the frequency of maximum power (typical uncertainty \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\}\$=1.6{\textbackslash}\%), the mean large frequency separation (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}nu\}\$=0.6{\textbackslash}\%), oscillation amplitude (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm A\}\$=4.7{\textbackslash}\%), granulation power (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gran\}\$=8.6{\textbackslash}\%), power excess width (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm width\}\$=8.8{\textbackslash}\%), seismically-derived stellar mass (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\$=7.8{\textbackslash}\%), radius (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm R\}\$=2.9{\textbackslash}\%), and thus surface gravity (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}log g\}\$=0.01 dex). Thanks to the large red giant sample, we confirm that red-giant-branch (RGB) and helium-core-burning (HeB) stars collectively differ in the distribution of oscillation amplitude, granulation power, and width of power excess, which is mainly due to the mass difference. The distribution of oscillation amplitudes shows an extremely sharp upper edge at fixed \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$, which might hold clues to understand the excitation and damping mechanisms of the oscillation modes. We find both oscillation amplitude and granulation power depend on metallicity, causing a spread of 15{\textbackslash}\% in oscillation amplitudes and a spread of 25{\textbackslash}\% in granulation power from [Fe/H]=-0.7 to 0.5 dex. Our asteroseismic stellar properties can be used as reliable distance indicators and age proxies for mapping and dating galactic stellar populations observed by Kepler. They will also provide an excellent opportunity to test asteroseismology using Gaia parallaxes, and lift degeneracies in deriving atmospheric parameters in large spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE and LAMOST.},

	abstract = {Binary systems are very common among field stars. While this relatively small number of planets in binaries is probably partly due to strong observational biases, there is, however, statistical evidence that planets are indeed less frequent in binaries with separations smaller than 100 au, strongly suggesting that the presence of a close in companion star has an adverse effect on planet formation. It is indeed possible for the gravitational pull of the second star to affect all the different stages of planet formation, from proto-planetary disk formation to dust accumulation into planetesimals, to the accretion of these planetesimals into large planetary embryos and, eventually, the final growth of these embryos into planets. For the crucial planetesimal accretion phase, the complex coupling between dynamical perturbations from the binary and friction due to gas in the protoplanetary disk suggests that planetesimal accretion might be hampered due to increased, accretion hostile impact velocities. Likewise, the interplay between the binary secular perturbations and mean motion resonances lead to unstable regions, where not only planet formation is inhibited, but where a massive body would be ejected from the system on a hyperbolic orbit. The amplitude of these two main effects is different for S and P type planets, so that a comparison between the two populations might outline the influence of the companion star on the planet formation process. Unfortunately, at present the two populations (circumstellar or circumbinary) are not known equally well and different biases and uncertainties prevent a quantitative comparison. We also highlight the long term dynamical evolution of both S and P type systems and focus on how these different evolutions influence the final architecture of planetary systems in binaries.},

	abstract = {Mutual gravitation between a pulsating star and an orbital companion leads to a time-dependent variation in path length for starlight traveling to Earth. These variations can be used for coherently pulsating stars, such as the δ Scuti variables, to constrain the masses and orbits of their companions. Observing these variations for δ Scuti stars has previously relied on subdividing the light curve and measuring the average pulsation phase in equally sized subdivisions, which leads to under-sampling near periapsis. We introduce a new approach that simultaneously forward-models each sample in the light curve and show that this method improves upon current sensitivity limits - especially in the case of highly eccentric and short-period binaries. We ﬁnd that this approach is sensitive enough to observe Jupiter mass planets around δ Scuti stars under ideal conditions, and use gravity-mode pulsations in the subdwarf B star KIC 7668647 to detect its companion without radial velocity data. We further provide robust detection limits as a function of the SNR of the pulsation mode and determine that the minimum detectable light travel time amplitude for a typical Kepler δ Scuti is around 2 s. This new method signiﬁcantly enhances the application of light travel time variations to detecting short period binaries with pulsating components, and pulsating A-type exoplanet host stars, especially as a tool for eliminating false positives.},

Yet even though neural network models see increasing use in the physical sciences, they struggle to learn these symmetries. In this paper, we propose Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), which can parameterize arbitrary Lagrangians using neural networks. In contrast to models that learn Hamiltonians, LNNs do not require canonical coordinates, and thus perform well in situations where canonical momenta are unknown or difficult to compute. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not restrict the functional form of learned energies and will produce energy-conserving models for a variety of tasks. We test our approach on a double pendulum and a relativistic particle, demonstrating energy conservation where a baseline approach incurs dissipation and modeling relativity without canonical coordinates where a Hamiltonian approach fails. Finally, we show how this model can be applied to graphs and continuous systems using a Lagrangian Graph Network, and demonstrate it on the 1D wave equation.},

Specifically, we propose a novel generalized-mean-loss to encourage each theory to specialize in its comparatively advantageous domain, and a differentiable description length objective to downweight bad data and "snap" learned theories into simple symbolic formulas. Theories are stored in a "theory hub", which continuously unifies learned theories and can propose theories when encountering new environments. We test our implementation, the toy "AI Physicist" learning agent, on a suite of increasingly complex physics environments. From unsupervised observation of trajectories through worlds involving random combinations of gravity, electromagnetism, harmonic motion and elastic bounces, our agent typically learns faster and produces mean-squared prediction errors about a billion times smaller than a standard feedforward neural net of comparable complexity, typically recovering integer and rational theory parameters exactly. Our agent successfully identifies domains with different laws of motion also for a nonlinear chaotic double pendulum in a piecewise constant force field.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05665},
	abstract = {Wide hot subdwarf B (sdB) binaries with main-sequence companions are outcomes of stable mass transfer from evolved red giants. The orbits of these binaries show a strong correlation between their orbital periods and mass ratios. The origins of this correlation have, so far, been lacking a conclusive explanation. We aim to find a binary evolution model which can explain the observed correlation. Radii of evolved red giants, and hence the resulting orbital periods, strongly depend on their metallicity. We have performed a small but statistically significant binary population synthesis study with the binary stellar evolution code MESA. We have used a standard model for binary mass loss and a standard metallicity history of the Galaxy. The resulting sdB systems were selected based on the same criteria as used in observations and then compared with the observed population. We have achieved an excellent match to the observed period - mass ratio correlation without using any free parameters. Furthermore, our models produce a very good match to the observed period - metallicity correlation. We predict several new correlations which link the observed sdB binaries to their progenitors, and a correlation between the orbital period, metallicity and core mass for subdwarfs and young low-mass white dwarfs. We also predict a new population of sdB binaries in the galactic bulge. We demonstrate, for the first time, how the metallicity history of the Milky Way is imprinted in the properties of the observed post-mass transfer binaries. We show that Galactic chemical evolution is an important factor in binary population studies of any systems containing at least one evolved low-mass (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm init\} {\textless} 1.6{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) component. Finally, we provide an observationally supported model of mass transfer from low-mass red giants onto main-sequence stars.},

	abstract = {The study of detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters can provide stringent tests of theoretical stellar evolutionary models, which must simultaneously fit the masses, radii, and luminosities of the eclipsing stars and the radiative properties of every other star in the cluster. We review recent progress in such studies and discuss two unusually interesting objects currently under analysis. GV Carinae is an A0m + A8m binary in the Southern open cluster NGC 3532; its eclipse depths have changed by 0.1 mag between 1990 and 2001, suggesting that its orbit is being perturbed by a relatively close third body. DW Carinae is a high-mass unevolved B1V + B1V binary in the very young open cluster Collinder 228, and displays double-peaked emission in the centre of the Halpha line which is characteristic of Be stars. We conclude by pointing out that the great promise of eclipsing binaries in open clusters can only be satisfied when both the binaries and their parent clusters are well-observed, a situation which is less common than we would like.},

	abstract = {Russell (1948) famously described eclipses as the "royal road" to stellar astrophysics. From photometric and spectroscopic observations it is possible to measure the masses and radii (to 1\% or better!), and thus surface gravities and mean densities, of stars in eclipsing binary systems using nothing more than geometry. Adding an effective temperature subsequently yields luminosity and then distance (or vice versa) to high precision. This wealth of directly measurable quantities makes eclipsing binaries the primary source of empirical information on the properties of stars, and therefore a cornerstone of stellar astrophysics. In this review paper I summarise the current standing of eclipsing binary research, present an overview of useful analysis techniques, and conclude with a glance to the future.},

	abstract = {Binary stars produce an array of dramatic astrophysical phenomena. They allow us to probe stellar structure, nuclear physics, and gravitational wave physics. They also produce the powerful supernovae that allow us to measure the scale of the universe. Despite their importance and ubiquity, many questions remain unanswered as to how the star formation process produces the wide array of stellar multiples that we observe. A complete model for binary formation encompasses three main components. We must know: (1) the primordial population of systems, (2) the influence of the dynamical processes that reshape this distribution as stars form and natal clusters disperse, and (3) the role of binary stellar evolution. In this article I review the most prominent theories for binary formation: turbulent core fragmentation, disk fragmentation, and competitive accretion. I argue that turbulent core fragmentation at all masses, with disk fragmentation added in at the upper end of the mass spectrum, might explain the trend towards increasing multiplicity for higher mass stars. In addition, I provide a brief overview of the observational statistics and of some of the important processes that modify the primordial distribution of stellar orbits.},

When at least one star in a binary has evolved off of the main sequence, orbital circularization occurs for longer-period ({\textasciitilde}100 day) systems. Past work by (Verbunt \& Phinney 1995) has shown that the orbital parameters and the circularization periods of a small sample of binary stars with evolved-star members can be understood within the context of standard tidal circularization theory. Using a sample of binaries with subgiant, giant, and red clump star members that is nearly an order of magnitude larger, we reexamine predictions for tidal circularization of binary stars with evolved members. We confirm that systems predicted by equilibrium-tide theory to have circular orbits generally have negligible measured eccentricities. The circularization period is correlated with the surface gravity (i.e. size) of the evolved member, indicating that the circularization timescale must be shorter than the evolutionary timescale along the giant branch. A few exceptions to the conclusions above are mentioned in the discussion: Some of these exceptions are likely systems in which the spectrum of the secondary biases the radial velocity measurements, but four appear to be genuine, short-period, moderate-eccentricity systems.},

Observing this effect is challenging, because it requires large and well-characterized samples including both hot and cool stars. Here we seek evidence for the predicted dependence of circularization upon stellar type, using a sample of 945 eclipsing binaries observed by Kepler. This sample complements earlier studies of this effect, which employed smaller samples of better-characterized stars. For each Kepler binary we measure \$e{\textbackslash}cos{\textbackslash}omega\$ based on the relative timing of the primary and secondary eclipses. We examine the distribution of \$e{\textbackslash}cos{\textbackslash}omega\$ as a function of period for binaries composed of hot stars, cool stars, and mixtures of the two types. At the shortest periods, hot-hot binaries are most likely to be eccentric; for periods shorter than 4 days, significant eccentricities occur frequently for hot-hot binaries, but not for hot-cool or cool-cool binaries. This is in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations based on the slower dissipation rates of hot stars. However, the interpretation of our results is complicated by the largely unknown ages and evolutionary states of the stars in our sample.},

The new results mostly corroborate those obtained by Zahn and Bouchet in the mass interval M = 0.5–1.25 M covered by their work. To compare the theoretically expected results with observations, a catalogue is compiled of 70 eclipsing binaries with eccentric orbits and bona ﬁde photometric elements and masses. The pre-MS lifetimes of all these systems are computed as fractions of the circularization time-scale tPMS/tcirc in terms of the Zahn theory and assuming the conservation of angular momentum L. All systems of this catalogue ﬁll almost uniformly the entire domain of the eobs–tPMS/tcirc diagram independently of tPMS/tcirc [i.e. the (tPMS/tcirc)cr = 4 threshold does not separate circular and eccentric systems in this diagram]. This result shows that the computations of the orbital circularization at the pre-MS stage based on the concept of the conservation of L have nothing to do with the actually observed distribution of the eccentricities of close binary systems. The results obtained lead us to the following conclusions. (i) Binaries appear to cross the Hayashi phase in a more detached state than we observe them on the MS, and therefore they are unaffected by tidal circularization at this stage. (ii) Binaries must lose an appreciable fraction of their angular momentum while evolving from the Hayashi phase to the zero-age main sequence. This loss may be a result of the dynamic interaction with the parent disc and other components of the multiple system.},

	abstract = {The primary Kepler Mission provided nearly continuous monitoring of ∼200,000 objects with unprecedented photometric precision. We present the final catalog of eclipsing binary systems within the 105 deg2 Kepler field of view. This release incorporates the full extent of the data from the primary mission (Q0-Q17 Data Release). As a result, new systems have been added, additional false positives have been removed, ephemerides and principal parameters have been recomputed, classifications have been revised to rely on analytical models, and eclipse timing variations have been computed for each system. We identify several classes of systems including those that exhibit tertiary eclipse events, systems that show clear evidence of additional bodies, heartbeat systems, systems with changing eclipse depths, and systems exhibiting only one eclipse event over the duration of the mission. We have updated the period and galactic latitude distribution diagrams and included a catalog completeness evaluation. The total number of identified eclipsing and ellipsoidal binary systems in the Kepler field of view has increased to 2878, 1.3\% of all observed Kepler targets. An online version of this catalog with downloadable content and visualization tools is maintained at http://keplerEBs.villanova.edu.},

	abstract = {We present a new homogeneous sample of 32 spectroscopic binary orbits in the young (∼ 150 Myr) main-sequence open cluster M35. The distribution of orbital eccentricity vs. orbital period (e − log(P )) displays a distinct transition from eccentric to circular orbits at an orbital period of ∼ 10 days. The transition is due to tidal circularization of the closest binaries. The population of binary orbits in M35 provide a signiﬁcantly improved constraint on the rate of tidal circularization at an age of 150 Myr. We propose a new and more robust diagnostic of the degree of tidal circularization in a binary population based on a functional ﬁt to the e − log(P ) distribution. We call this new measure the tidal circularization period. The tidal circularization period of a binary population represents the orbital period at which a binary orbit with the most frequent initial orbital eccentricity circularizes (deﬁned as e = 0.01) at the age of the population. We determine the tidal circularization period for M35 as well as for 7 additional binary populations spanning ages from the pre main-sequence (∼ 3 Myr) to late main-sequence (∼ 10 Gyr), and use Monte Carlo error analysis to determine the uncertainties on the derived circularization periods. We conclude that current theories of tidal circularization cannot account for the distribution of tidal circularization periods with population age.},

The pace at which this final state is achieved depends on the physical processes that are responsible for the dissipation of the tidal kinetic energy. For stars (or planets) with an outer convection zone, the dominant mechanism identified so far is the viscous dissipation acting on the equilibrium tide. For stars with an outer radiation zone, it is the radiative damping operating on the dynamical tide. After a brief presentation of the tides, I shall review these physical processes; I shall discuss the uncertainties of their present treatment, describe the latest developments, and compare the theoretical predictions with the observed properties concerning the orbital circularization of close binaries.},

As with most non-trivial observables, a simple histogram of estimated eccentricities is not a good estimate of the true eccentricity distribution. Here we develop and test a hierarchical probabilistic method for performing the relevant meta-analysis, that is, inferring the true eccentricity distribution, taking as input the likelihood functions for the individual-star eccentricities, or samplings of the posterior probability distributions for the eccentricities (under a given, uninformative prior). The method is a simple implementation of a hierarchical Bayesian model; it can also be seen as a kind of heteroscedastic deconvolution. It can be applied to any quantity measured with finite precision--other orbital parameters, or indeed any astronomical measurements of any kind, including magnitudes, parallaxes, or photometric redshifts--so long as the measurements have been communicated as a likelihood function or a posterior sampling.},

	abstract = {As a significant fraction of stars are in multiple systems, binaries play a crucial role in stellar evolution. Among short-period ({\textless}1 day) binary characteristics, age remains one of the most difficult to measure. In this paper, we constrain the lifetime of short-period binaries through their kinematics. With the kinematic information from Gaia Data Release 2 and light curves from \{{\textbackslash}it Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer\} (WISE), we investigate the eclipsing binary fraction as a function of kinematics for a volume-limited main-sequence sample. We find that the eclipsing binary fraction peaks at a tangential velocity of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{1.3-1.6\}\$ km/s, and decreases towards both low and high velocity end. This implies that thick disk and halo stars have eclipsing binary fraction \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10\$ times smaller than the thin-disk stars. This is further supported by the dependence of eclipsing binary fraction on the Galactic latitude. Using Galactic models, we show that our results are inconsistent with any known dependence of binary fraction on metallicity. Instead, our best-fit models suggest that the formation of these short-period binaries is delayed by 0.6-3 Gyr, and the disappearing time is less than the age of the thick disk. The delayed formation time of \${\textbackslash}gtrsim0.6\$ Gyr implies that these short-period main-sequence binaries cannot be formed by pre-main sequence interaction and the Kozai-Lidov mechanism alone, and suggests that magnetic braking plays a key role in their formation. Because the main-sequence lifetime of our sample is longer than 14 Gyr, if the disappearance of short-period binaries in the old population is due to their finite lifetime, our results imply that most (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim90\$\%) short-period binaries in our sample merge during their main-sequence stage.},

Moreover, the secular phase space for a generic gravitationally bound pair is similar to the dynamical structure of a Lidov-Kozai resonance, but surprisingly this structure is independent of the masses and semimajor axis of the binary system. Thus, the Galactic potential is able to excite the initially circular orbit of binary systems to high values of eccentricity, which has important implications for studies of binary star systems (with and without exoplanets), comets, and Oort cloud objects.},

This increased astrometric precision presents an opportunity to find new binary stars and moving groups. We search for high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS by identifying pairs of stars consistent with having the same 3D velocity using a marginalized likelihood ratio test to discriminate candidate comoving pairs from the field population. Although we perform some visualizations using (bias- corrected) inverse parallax as a point estimate of distance, the likelihood ratio is computed with a probabilistic model that includes the covariances of parallax and proper motions and marginalizes the (unknown) true distances and 3D velocities of the stars. We find 13,085 comoving star pairs among 10,606 unique stars with separations as large as 10 pc (our search limit). Some of these pairs form larger groups through mutual comoving neighbors: many of these pair networks correspond to known open clusters and OB associations, but we also report the discovery of several new comoving groups. Most surprisingly, we find a large number of very wide (\${\textgreater}1\$ pc) separation comoving star pairs, the number of which increases with increasing separation and cannot be explained purely by false-positive contamination. Our key result is a catalog of high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS. We discuss the utility of this catalog for making dynamical inferences about the Galaxy, testing stellar atmosphere models, and validating chemical abundance measurements.},

Speed and direction of the relative motion are determined from the short observed arcs or known orbits, and their joint distribution is compared to the numerical simulations. By inverting the observed distribution with the help of simulations, we ﬁnd that average eccentricity of wide binaries is 0.59 ± 0.02 and the eccentricity distribution can be modelled as f(e) ≈ 1.2e + 0.4. However, wide binaries containing inner subsystems, i.e. triple or higher order multiples, have signiﬁcantly smaller eccentricities with the average e = 0.52 ± 0.05 and the peak at e ∼ 0.5. We ﬁnd that the catalogue of visual orbits is strongly biased against large eccentricities. A marginal evidence of eccentricity increasing with separation (or period) is found for this sample. Comparison with spectroscopic binaries proves the reality of the controversial period–eccentricity relation. The average eccentricity does increase with binary period, being 0.39 for periods from 102 to 103 d and 0.59 for the binaries studied here (105–106 d).},

We place the smoothed light curves of 30 type ab and 10 type c RR Lyrae stars in 1007 fields across the sky, each of which represents a different realization of the LSST sampling cadences, and that sample five particular observing modes. A light curve simulation tool was used to sample the idealized RR Lyrae stars' light curves, returning each as it would have been observed by LSST, including realistic photometric scatter, limiting magnitudes, and telescope downtime. We report here the period, brightness, and light curve shape recovery as a function of apparent magnitude and for survey lengths varying from 1 to 10 years. We find that 10 years of LSST data are sufficient to recover the pulsation periods with a fractional precision of ∼10–5 for ⩾90\% of ab stars within ≈360 kpc of the Sun in Universal Cadence fields and out to ≈760 kpc for Deep Drilling fields. The 50\% completeness level extends to ≈600 kpc and ≈1.0 Mpc for the same fields, respectively. For virtually all stars that had their periods recovered, their light curve shape parameter ϕ31 was recovered with sufficient precision to also recover photometric metallicities to within 0.14 dex (the systematic error in the photometric relations). With RR Lyrae stars' periods and metallicities well measured to these distances, LSST will be able to search for halo streams and dwarf satellite galaxies over half of the Local Group, informing galaxy formation models and providing essential data for mapping the Galactic potential. This study also informs the LSST science operations plan for optimizing observing strategies to achieve particular science goals.

	abstract = {M dwarfs have enormous potential for our understanding of structure and formation on both Galactic and exoplanetary scales through their properties and compositions. However, current atmosphere models have limited ability to reproduce spectral features in stars at the coolest temperatures (T eff {\textless} 4200 K) and to fully exploit the information content of current and upcoming large-scale spectroscopic surveys. Here we present a catalog of spectroscopic temperatures, metallicities, and spectral types for 5875 M dwarfs in the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and Gaia-DR2 surveys using The Cannon: a flexible, data-driven spectral-modeling and parameter-inference framework demonstrated to estimate stellar-parameter labels (, , , and detailed abundances) to high precision. Using a training sample of 87 M dwarfs with optically derived labels spanning calibrated with bolometric temperatures, and dex calibrated with FGK binary metallicities, we train a two-parameter model with predictive accuracy (in cross-validation) to 77 K and 0.09 dex respectively. We also train a one-dimensional spectral classification model using 51 M dwarfs with Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical spectral types ranging from M0 to M6, to predictive accuracy of 0.7 types. We find Cannon temperatures to be in agreement to within 60 K compared to a subsample of 1702 sources with color-derived temperatures, and Cannon metallicities to be in agreement to within 0.08 dex metallicity compared to a subsample of 15 FGK+M or M+M binaries. Finally, our comparison between Cannon and APOGEE pipeline (ASPCAP DR14) labels finds that ASPCAP is systematically biased toward reporting higher temperatures and lower metallicities for M dwarfs.},

	abstract = {We present a new algorithm for detecting transiting extrasolar planets in time-series photometry. The Quasiperiodic Automated Transit Search (QATS) algorithm relaxes the usual assumption of strictly periodic transits by permitting a variable, but bounded, interval between successive transits. We show that this method is capable of detecting transiting planets with significant transit timing variations without any loss of significance—“smearing”—as would be incurred with traditional algorithms; however, this is at the cost of a slightly increased stochastic background. The approximate times of transit are standard products of the QATS search. Despite the increased flexibility, we show that QATS has a run-time complexity that is comparable to traditional search codes and is comparably easy to implement. QATS is applicable to data having a nearly uninterrupted, uniform cadence and is therefore well suited to the modern class of space-based transit searches (e.g., Kepler, CoRoT). Applications of QATS include transiting planets in dynamically active multi-planet systems and transiting planets in stellar binary systems.},

We present a set of techniques for photometric classification that can be applied even when the training set of spectroscopically-confirmed objects is heavily biased towards bright, low-redshift objects. Using Gaussian process regression to model arbitrary light curves in all bands simultaneously, we "augment" the training set by generating new versions of the original light curves covering a range of redshifts and observing conditions. We train a boosted decision tree classifier on features extracted from the augmented light curves, and we show how such a classifier can be designed to produce classifications that are independent of the redshift distributions of objects in the training sample. Our classification algorithm was the best-performing among the 1,094 models considered in the blinded phase of the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC), scoring 0.468 on the organizers' logarithmic-loss metric with flat weights for all object classes in the training set, and achieving an AUC of 0.957 for classification of Type Ia supernovae. Our results suggest that spectroscopic campaigns used for training photometric classifiers should focus on typing large numbers of well-observed, intermediate redshift transients instead of attempting to type a sample of transients that is directly representative of the full dataset being classified. All of the algorithms described in this paper are implemented in the avocado software package.},

	abstract = {RR Lyrae stars may be the best practical tracers of Galactic halo (sub-)structure and kinematics. The PanSTARRS1 (PS1) survey offers multi-band, multi-epoch, precise photometry across much of the sky, but a robust identification of RR Lyrae stars in this data set poses a challenge, given PS1's sparse, asynchronous multi-band light curves ( epochs in each of five bands, taken over a 4.5 year period). We present a novel template fitting technique that uses well-defined and physically motivated multi-band light curves of RR Lyrae stars, and demonstrate that we get accurate period estimates, precise to 2 s in of cases. We augment these light-curve fits with other features from photometric time-series and provide them to progressively more detailed machine-learned classification models. From these models, we are able to select the widest (three-fourths of the sky) and deepest (reaching 120 kpc) sample of RR Lyrae stars to date. The PS1 sample of ∼45,000 RRab stars is pure (90\%) and complete (80\% at 80 kpc) at high galactic latitudes. It also provides distances that are precise to 3\%, measured with newly derived period–luminosity relations for optical/near-infrared PS1 bands. With the addition of proper motions from Gaia and radial velocity measurements from multi-object spectroscopic surveys, we expect the PS1 sample of RR Lyrae stars to become the premier source for studying the structure, kinematics, and the gravitational potential of the Galactic halo. The techniques presented in this study should translate well to other sparse, multi-band data sets, such as those produced by the Dark Energy Survey and the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Galactic plane sub-survey.},

	abstract = {The orbits of binary stars and planets, particularly eccentricities and inclinations, encode the angular momentum within these systems. Within stellar multiple systems, the magnitude and (mis)alignment of angular momentum vectors among stars, disks, and planets probes the complex dynamical processes guiding their formation and evolution. The accuracy of the {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} catalog can be exploited to enable comparison of binary orbits with known planet or disk inclinations without costly long-term astrometric campaigns. We show that {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} astrometry can place meaningful limits on orbital elements in cases with reliable astrometry, and discuss metrics for assessing the reliability of {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} DR2 solutions for orbit fitting. We demonstrate our method by determining orbital elements for three systems (DS Tuc AB, GK/GI Tau, and Kepler-25/KOI-1803) using {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} astrometry alone. We show that DS Tuc AB's orbit is nearly aligned with the orbit of DS Tuc Ab, GK/GI Tau's orbit might be misaligned with their respective protoplanetary disks, and the Kepler-25/KOI-1803 orbit is not aligned with either component's transiting planetary system. We also demonstrate cases where {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} astrometry alone fails to provide useful constraints on orbital elements. To enable broader application of this technique, we introduce the python tool {\textbackslash}texttt\{lofti{\textbackslash}\_gaiaDR2\} to allow users to easily determine orbital element posteriors.},

	abstract = {A number of problems in probability and statistics can be addressed using the multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the \$n\$-dimensional setting, however, it requires the inversion of an \$n {\textbackslash}times n\$ covariance matrix, \$C\$, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, \${\textbackslash}det(C)\$. In many cases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of the form \$C = {\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2 I + K\$, where \$K\$ is computed using a specified covariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters (hyperparameters). The matrix \$C\$ is typically dense, causing standard direct methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require \${\textbackslash}mathcal O(n{\textasciicircum}3)\$ work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix \$C\$ can be hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the identity matrix, yielding an \${\textbackslash}mathcal O (n{\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2 n) \$ algorithm for inversion. More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant \${\textbackslash}det(C)\$, permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining \$K\$. Our fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance computing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable problems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance kernels.},

	abstract = {Few observational constraints exist for the tidal synchronization rate of late-type stars, despite its fundamental role in binary evolution. We visually inspected the light curves of 2278 eclipsing binaries (EBs) from the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog to identify those with starspot modulations, as well as other types of out-of-eclipse variability. We report rotation periods for 816 EBs with starspot modulations, and find that 79\% of EBs with orbital periods of less than 10 days are synchronized. However, a population of short-period EBs exists, with rotation periods typically 13\% slower than synchronous, which we attribute to the differential rotation of high-latitude starspots. At 10 days, there is a transition from predominantly circular, synchronized EBs to predominantly eccentric, pseudosynchronized EBs. This transition period is in good agreement with the predicted and observed circularization period for Milky Way field binaries. At orbital periods greater than about 30 days, the amount of tidal synchronization decreases. We also report 12 previously unidentified candidate δ Scuti and γ Doradus pulsators, as well as a candidate RS CVn system with an evolved primary that exhibits starspot occultations. For short-period contact binaries, we observe a period–color relation and compare it to previous studies. As a whole, these results represent the largest homogeneous study of tidal synchronization of late-type stars.},

	abstract = {Satellites orbiting disc galaxies can induce phase space features such as spirality, vertical heating and phase-mixing in their discs. Such features have also been observed in our own Galaxy, but the complexity of the Milky Way disc has only recently been fully mapped thanks to Gaia DR2 data. This complex behaviour is mainly ascribed to repeated perturbations induced by the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) along its orbit, pointing to this satellite as the main dynamical architect of the Milky Way disc. Here, we model Gaia DR2 observed colour-magnitude diagrams to obtain the first detailed star formation history of the {\textasciitilde} 2-kpc bubble around the Sun. It reveals three conspicuous and narrow episodes of enhanced star formation that we can precisely date as having occurred 5.7, 1.9 and 1 Gyr ago. Interestingly, the timing of these episodes coincides with proposed Sgr pericentre passages according to i) orbit simulations, ii) phase space features in the Galactic disc, and iii) Sgr stellar content. These findings most likely suggest that Sgr has also been an important actor in the build-up of the Milky Way disc stellar mass, with its perturbations repeatedly triggering major episodes of star formation.},

We observe that equivalent widths of lines can increase as a function of the activity index log R\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}prime\_\{{\textbackslash}rm HK\}\$ during the stellar cycle, which also produces an artificial growth of the stellar microturbulence and a decrease in effective temperature and metallicity.

New observational aspects of this work include surveys for (1) very close companions with long-baseline interferometry at the CHARA Array, (2) close companions with speckle interferometry, and (3) wide proper motion companions identified by blinking multi-epoch archival images. In addition, we include the results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and evaluate companion information from various catalogs. The overall observed fractions of single, double, triple, and higher order systems are 56\% {\textbackslash}pm 2\%, 33\% {\textbackslash}pm 2\%, 8\% {\textbackslash}pm 1\%, and 3\% {\textbackslash}pm 1\%, respectively, counting all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. Our completeness analysis indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this well-studied sample, implying that the majority (54\% {\textbackslash}pm 2\%) of solar-type stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. The orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log-normal with a peak of about 300 years. The period-eccentricity relation shows a roughly flat distribution beyond the expected circularization for periods below 12 days. The mass-ratio distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs, which occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet hosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around single stars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems with sufficiently wide separations.},

In addition to all aspects of single-star evolution, features such as mass transfer, mass accretion, common-envelope evolution, collisions, supernova kicks and angular momentum loss mechanisms are included. In particular, circularization and synchronization of the orbit by tidal interactions are calculated for convective, radiative and degenerate damping mechanisms. We use this algorithm to study the formation and evolution of various binary systems. We also investigate the effect that tidal friction has on the outcome of binary evolution. Using the rapid binary code, we generate a series of large binary populations and evaluate the formation rate of interesting individual species and events. By comparing the results for populations with and without tidal friction, we quantify the hitherto ignored systematic effect of tides and show that modelling of tidal evolution in binary systems is necessary in order to draw accurate conclusions from population synthesis work. Tidal synchronism is important but, because orbits generally circularize before Roche lobe overﬂow, the outcome of the interactions of systems with the same semilatus rectum is almost independent of eccentricity. It is not necessary to include a distribution of eccentricities in population synthesis of interacting binaries; however, the initial separations should be distributed according to the observed distribution of semilatera recta rather than periods or semimajor axes.},

	abstract = {A common problem in disciplines of applied Statistics research such as Astrostatistics is of estimating the posterior distribution of relevant parameters. Typically, the likelihoods for such models are computed via expensive experiments such as cosmological simulations of the universe. An urgent challenge in these research domains is to develop methods that can estimate the posterior with few likelihood evaluations. In this paper, we study active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate. Existing techniques for posterior estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior. Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes. Via experiments on a series of synthetic and real examples we demonstrate that our approach is significantly more query efficient than existing techniques and other heuristics for posterior estimation.},

WHFAST is signiﬁcantly faster and conserves energy better than all other Wisdom–Holman integrators tested. We achieve this by signiﬁcantly improving the Kepler solver and ensuring numerical stability of coordinate transformations to and from Jacobi coordinates. These reﬁnements allow us to remove the linear secular trend in the energy error that is present in other implementations. For small enough timesteps, we achieve Brouwer’s law, i.e. the energy error is dominated by an unbiased random walk due to ﬂoating-point round-off errors. We implement symplectic correctors up to order 11 that signiﬁcantly reduce the energy error. We also implement a symplectic tangent map for the variational equations. This allows us to efﬁciently calculate two widely used chaos indicators the Lyapunov characteristic number and the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits. WHFAST is freely available as a ﬂexible C package, as a shared library, and as an easy-to-use PYTHON module.},

A quantification of the frequency and proximity of close stellar encounters in this environment dictates the exchange of material, disruption of planetary orbits, and threat of sterilizing energetic events. We present estimated encounter rates for stars in the Milky Way bulge found using a combination of numerical and analytical methods. By integrating the orbits of bulge stars with varying orbital energy and angular momentum to find their positions over time, we were able to estimate how many close stellar encounters the stars should experience as a function of orbit shape. We determined that {\textasciitilde}80\% of bulge stars have encounters within 1000 AU and that half of bulge stars will have {\textgreater}35 such encounters, both over a gigayear.

	abstract = {A number of giant planet pairs discovered by the radial velocity method with period ratios \${\textbackslash}lesssim 2 \$ may reside in mean motion resonances. Convergent orbital migration and resonant capture at the time of formation would naturally explain the present-day resonant orbital configurations of these systems. Planets that experience smooth migration and eccentricity damping forces due to a proto-planetary disk should not only capture into mean motion resonances but also end up in a specific dynamical configuration within the resonance, sometimes referred to as apsidal corotation resonance (ACR). Here we develop a method for testing the hypothesis that a planet pair resides in an ACR by directly fitting radial velocity data. The ACR hypothesis strongly restricts the number of free parameters describing the radial velocity signal and we compare fits using this highly restricted model to fits using a more conventional two-planet RV model by using nested sampling simulations. We apply our method to HD 45364 and HD 33844, two systems hosting giant planet pairs in 3:2 and 5:3 resonances, respectively. We demonstrate that the observations of both systems support an ACR configuration and we use the results of our ACR model fits to constrain possible migration histories of these systems.},

	abstract = {We have shown that data-driven models are effective for inferring physical attributes of stars (labels; Teff, logg, [M/H]) from spectra, even when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. Here we explore whether this is possible when the dimensionality of the label space is large (Teff, logg, and 15 abundances: C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni) and the model is non-linear in its response to abundance and parameter changes. We adopt ideas from compressed sensing to limit overall model complexity while retaining model freedom. The model is trained with a set of 12,681 red-giant stars with high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations and stellar parameters and abundances taken from the APOGEE Survey. We find that we can successfully train and use a model with 17 stellar labels. Validation shows that the model does a good job of inferring all 17 labels (typical abundance precision is 0.04 dex), even when we degrade the signal-to-noise by discarding {\textasciitilde}50\% of the observing time. The model dependencies make sense: the spectral derivatives with respect to abundances correlate with known atomic lines, and we identify elements belonging to atomic lines that were previously unknown. We recover (anti-)correlations in abundance labels for globular cluster stars, consistent with the literature. However we find the intrinsic spread in globular cluster abundances is 3--4 times smaller than previously reported. We deliver 17 labels with associated errors for 87,563 red giant stars, as well as open-source code to extend this work to other spectroscopic surveys.},

	abstract = {The rotational evolution of cool dwarfs is poorly constrained after ∼1-2 Gyr due to a lack of precise ages and rotation periods for old main-sequence stars. In this work we use velocity dispersion as an age proxy to reveal the temperature-dependent rotational evolution of low-mass Kepler dwarfs, and demonstrate that kinematic ages could be a useful tool for calibrating gyrochronology in the future. We ﬁnd that a linear gyrochronology model, calibrated to ﬁt the period–Teﬀ relationship of the Praesepe cluster, does not apply to stars older than around 1 Gyr. Although late-K dwarfs spin more slowly than early-K dwarfs when they are young, at old ages we ﬁnd that late-K dwarfs rotate at the same rate or faster than early-K dwarfs of the same age. This result agrees qualitatively with semi-empirical models that vary the rate of surface-to-core angular momentum transport as a function of time and mass. It also aligns with recent observations of stars in the NGC 6811 cluster, which indicate that the surface rotation rates of K dwarfs go through an epoch of inhibited evolution. We ﬁnd that the oldest Kepler stars with measured rotation periods are late-K and early-M dwarfs, indicating that these stars maintain spotted surfaces and stay magnetically active longer than more massive stars. Finally, based on their kinematics, we conﬁrm that many rapidly rotating GKM dwarfs are likely to be synchronized binaries.},

	abstract = {Recent analyses have shown that the concluding stages of giant planet formation are accompanied by the development of large-scale meridional flow of gas inside the planetary Hill sphere. This circulation feeds a circumplanetary disk that viscously expels gaseous material back into the parent nebula, maintaining the system in a quasi-steady state. Here we investigate the formation of natural satellites of Jupiter and Saturn within the framework of this newly outlined picture. We begin by considering the long-term evolution of solid material, and demonstrate that the circumplanetary disk can act as a global dust trap, where \$s\_\{{\textbackslash}bullet\}{\textbackslash}sim0.1-10{\textbackslash},\$mm grains achieve a hydrodynamical equilibrium, facilitated by a balance between radial updraft and aerodynamic drag. This process leads to a gradual increase in the system's metallicity, and eventually culminates in the gravitational fragmentation of the outer regions of the solid sub-disk into \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{R\}{\textbackslash}sim100{\textbackslash},\$km satellitesimals. Subsequently, satellite conglomeration ensues via pairwise collisions, but is terminated when disk-driven orbital migration removes the growing objects from the satellitesimal feeding zone. The resulting satellite formation cycle can repeat multiple times, until it is brought to an end by photo-evaporation of the parent nebula. Numerical simulations of the envisioned formation scenario yield satisfactory agreement between our model and the known properties of the Jovian and Saturnian moons.},

We compare our simulations to the observed population of aligned eccentric high semimajor axis Kuiper belt objects and determine which simulation parameters are statistically compatible with the observations. We find that only a narrow range of orbital elements can reproduce the observations. In particular, the combination of semimajor axis, eccentricity, and mass of Planet Nine strongly dictates the semimajor axis range of the orbital confinement of the distant eccentric Kuiper belt objects. Allowed orbits, which confine Kuiper belt objects with semimajor axis beyond 380{\textasciitilde}AU, have perihelia roughly between 150 and 350{\textasciitilde}AU, semimajor axes between 380 and 980{\textasciitilde}AU, and masses between 5 and 20 Earth masses. Orbitally confined objects also generally have orbital planes similar to that of the planet, suggesting that the planet is inclined approximately 30{\textasciitilde}degrees to the ecliptic. We compare the allowed orbital positions and estimated brightness of Planet Nine to previous and ongoing surveys which would be sensitive to the planet's detection and use these surveys to rule out approximately two-thirds of the planet's orbit. Planet Nine is likely near aphelion with an approximate brightness of \$22{\textless}V{\textless}25\$. At opposition, its motion, mainly due to parallax, can easily be detected within 24 hours.},

However populations of wide binaries evolve over time due to interactions within a system’s birth environment and the unfolding of wide, hierarchical triple systems. Hence the wide binary populations observed in star forming regions or OB associations may not accurately reﬂect the wide binary populations that will eventually reach the ﬁeld. We use Gaia DR2 data to select members of three open clusters, Alpha Per, the Pleiades and Praesepe and to ﬂag cluster members that are likely unresolved binaries due to overluminosity or elevated astrometric noise. We then identify the resolved wide binary population in each cluster, separating it from coincident pairings of unrelated cluster members. We ﬁnd that these clusters have an average wide binary fraction in the 300-3000 AU projected separation range of 2.1±00..24\% increasing to 3.0±00..87\% for primaries with masses in the 0.5–1.5 M range. This is signiﬁcantly below the observed ﬁeld wide binary fraction, but shows some wide binaries survive in these dynamically highly processed environments. We compare our results with another open cluster (the Hyades) and two populations of young stars that likely originated in looser associations (Young Moving Groups and the Pisces-Eridanus stream). We ﬁnd that the Hyades also has a deﬁcit of wide binaries while the products of looser associations have wide binary fractions at or above ﬁeld level.},

	abstract = {We develop a data-driven model to map stellar parameters (effective
temperature, surface gravity and metallicity) accurately and precisely to
broad-band stellar photometry. This model must, and does, simultaneously
constrain the passband-specific dust reddening vector in the Milky Way. The
model uses a neural network to learn the (de-reddened) absolute magnitude in
one band and colors across many bands, given stellar parameters from
spectroscopic surveys and parallax constraints from Gaia. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach, we train our model on a dataset with
spectroscopic labels from LAMOST, APOGEE and GALAH, Gaia parallaxes, and
optical and near-infrared photometry from Gaia, Pan-STARRS 1, 2MASS and WISE.
Testing the model on these datasets leads to an excellent fit and a precise --
and by construction accurate -- prediction of the color-magnitude diagrams in
many bands. This flexible approach rigorously links spectroscopic and
photometric surveys, and also results in an improved, temperature-dependent
reddening vector. As such, it provides a simple and accurate method for
predicting photometry in stellar evolutionary models. Our model will form a
basis to infer stellar properties, distances and dust extinction from
photometric data, which should be of great use in 3D mapping of the Milky Way.

In this initial release, eleven physics modules are included that model internal, atmospheric, rotational, orbital, stellar, and galactic processes. Many of these modules can be coupled simultaneously to simulate the evolution of terrestrial planets, gaseous planets, and stars. The code is validated by reproducing a selection of observations and past results. VPLanet is written in C and designed so that the user can choose the physics modules to apply to an individual object at runtime without recompiling, i.e., a single executable can simulate the diverse phenomena that are relevant to a wide range of planetary and stellar systems. This feature is enabled by matrices and vectors of function pointers that are dynamically allocated and populated based on user input. The speed and modularity of VPLanet enables large parameter sweeps and the versatility to add/remove physical phenomena to assess their importance. VPLanet is publicly available from a repository that contains extensive documentation, numerous examples, Python scripts for plotting and data management, and infrastructure for community input and future development.},

We present statistics based on the determined periods and measure the average occurrence rate of eclipsing binaries to be ∼1.2\% across the Kepler ﬁeld. We further discuss the distribution of binaries as a function of galactic latitude and thoroughly explain the application of artiﬁcial intelligence to obtain principal parameters in a matter of seconds for the whole sample.

Thanks to its large ﬁeld of view and faint limiting magnitude, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) oﬀers a unique opportunity to detect variable stars in the northern sky. Here, we exploit ZTF Data Release 2 (DR2) to search for and classify variables down to r ∼ 20.6 mag. We classify 781,602 periodic variables into 11 main types using an improved classiﬁcation method. Comparison with previously published catalogs shows that 621,702 objects (79.5\%) are newly discovered or newly classiﬁed, including ∼700 Cepheids, ∼5000 RR Lyrae stars, ∼15,000 δ Scuti variables, ∼350,000 eclipsing binaries, ∼100,000 long-period variables, and about 150,000 rotational variables. The typical misclassiﬁcation rate and period accuracy are on the order of 2\% and 99\%, respectively. 74\% of our variables are located at Galactic latitudes, {\textbar}b{\textbar} {\textless} 10◦. This large sample of Cepheids, RR Lyrae, δ Scuti stars, and contact (EW-type) eclipsing binaries is helpful to investigate the Galaxy’s disk structure and evolution with an improved completeness, areal coverage, and age resolution. Speciﬁcally, the northern warp and the disk’s edge at distances of 15–20 kpc are signiﬁcantly better covered than previously. Among rotational variables, RS Canum Venaticorum and BY Draconis-type variables can be separated easily. Our knowledge of stellar chromospheric activity would beneﬁt greatly from a statistical analysis of these types of variables.},

This could explain why small obliquities were observed in the earliest measurements, which focused on relatively cool stars drawn from Doppler surveys, as opposed to hotter stars that emerged more recently from transit surveys. The observed trend could be due to differences in planet formation and migration around stars of varying mass. Alternatively, we speculate that hot-Jupiter systems begin with a wide range of obliquities, but the photospheres of cool stars realign with the orbits due to tidal dissipation in their convective zones, while hot stars cannot realign because of their thinner convective zones. This in turn would suggest that hot Jupiters originate from few-body gravitational dynamics and that disk migration plays at most a supporting role.},

We present the first optical probabilistic catalog, cataloging a crowded (∼0.1 sources per pixel brighter than 22nd mag in F606W) Sloan Digital Sky Survey r-band image from M2. Probabilistic cataloging returns an ensemble of catalogs inferred from the image and thus can capture source–source covariance and deblending ambiguities. By comparing to a traditional catalog of the same image and a Hubble Space Telescope catalog of the same region, we show that our catalog ensemble better recovers sources from the image. It goes more than a magnitude deeper than the traditional catalog while having a lower false-discovery rate brighter than 20th mag. We also present an algorithm for reducing this catalog ensemble to a condensed catalog that is similar to a traditional catalog, except that it explicitly marginalizes over source–source covariances and nuisance parameters. We show that this condensed catalog has a similar completeness and false-discovery rate to the catalog ensemble. Future telescopes will be more sensitive, and thus more of their images will be crowded. Probabilistic cataloging performs better than existing software in crowded fields and so should be considered when creating photometric pipelines in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era.},

We apply EVEREST to all K2 targets in campaigns 0-7, yielding light curves with precision comparable to that of the original Kepler mission for stars brighter than Kp ≈ 13, and within a factor of two of the Kepler precision for fainter targets. We perform cross-validation and transit injection and recovery tests to validate the pipeline, and compare our light curves to the other de-trended light curves available for download at the MAST High Level Science Products archive. We ﬁnd that EVEREST achieves the highest average precision of any of these pipelines for unsaturated K2 stars. The improved precision of these light curves will aid in exoplanet detection and characterization, investigations of stellar variability, asteroseismology, and other photometric studies. The EVEREST pipeline can also easily be applied to future surveys, such as the TESS mission, to correct for instrumental systematics and enable the detection of low signal-to-noise transiting exoplanets.

In particular, GPs are frequently employed to account for correlated stellar variability in planetary transit light curves. The efficient application of GPs to light curves containing thousands to tens of thousands of datapoints has been made possible by recent advances in GP methods, including the celerite method. Here we present an extension of the celerite method to two input dimensions, where, typically, the second dimension is small. This method scales linearly with the total number of datapoints when the noise in each large dimension is proportional to the same celerite kernel and only the amplitude of the correlated noise varies in the second dimension. We demonstrate the application of this method to the problem of measuring precise transit parameters from multiwavelength light curves and show that it has the potential to improve transit parameters measurements by orders of magnitude. Applications of this method include transit spectroscopy and exomoon detection, as well a broader set of astronomical problems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02836},
	abstract = {A new class of pulsating binary stars was recently discovered, whose pulsation amplitudes are strongly modulated with orbital phase. Stars in close binaries are tidally distorted, so we examine how a star's tidally induced asphericity affects its oscillation mode frequencies and eigenfunctions. We explain the pulsation amplitude modulation via tidal mode coupling such that the pulsations are effectively confined to certain regions of the star, e.g., the tidal pole or the tidal equator. In addition to a rigorous mathematical formalism to compute this coupling, we provide a more intuitive semi-analytic description of the process. We discuss three resulting effects: 1. Tidal alignment, i.e., the alignment of oscillation modes about the tidal axis rather than the rotation axis; 2. Tidal trapping, e.g., the confinement of oscillations near the tidal poles or the tidal equator; 3. Tidal amplification, i.e., increased flux perturbations near the tidal poles where acoustic modes can propagate closer to the surface of the star. Together, these phenomena can account for the pulsation amplitude and phase modulation of the recently discovered class of "tidally tilted pulsators." We compare our theory to the three tidally tilted pulsators HD 74423, CO Cam, and TIC 63328020, finding that tidally trapped modes that are axisymmetric about the tidal axis can largely explain the first two, while a non-axisymmetric tidally aligned mode is present in the latter. Finally, we discuss implications and limitations of the theory, and we make predictions for the many new tidally tilted pulsators likely to be discovered in the near future.},

	abstract = {We study tidal dissipation in stars with masses in the range \$0.1-1.6 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ throughout their evolution, including turbulent effective viscosity acting on equilibrium tides and inertial waves in convection zones, and internal gravity waves in radiation zones. We consider a range of stellar evolutionary models and incorporate the frequency-dependent effective viscosity acting on equilibrium tides based on the latest simulations. We compare the tidal flow and dissipation obtained with the conventional equilibrium tide, which is strictly invalid in convection zones, finding that the latter typically over-predicts the dissipation by a factor of 2-3. Dissipation of inertial waves is computed using a frequency-averaged formalism accounting for realistic stellar structure for the first time, and is the dominant mechanism for binary circularization and synchronization on the main sequence. Dissipation of gravity waves in the radiation zone assumes these waves to be fully damped (e.g.{\textasciitilde}by wave breaking), and is the dominant mechanism for planetary orbital decay. We calculate the critical planetary mass required for wave breaking as a function of stellar mass and age, and show that this mechanism predicts destruction of many hot Jupiters but probably not Earth-mass planets on the main sequence. We apply our results to compute tidal quality factors following stellar evolution, and tidal evolutionary timescales, for the orbital decay of hot Jupiters, and the spin synchronization and circularization of binary stars.

	abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large datasets. Gaussian Processes are a popular class of models used for this purpose but, since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small datasets. In this paper, we present a novel method for Gaussian Process modeling in one-dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the dataset. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series datasets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically-driven damped harmonic oscillators -- providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice -- but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable Gaussian Process methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

	abstract = {Variability in the light curves of spotted, rotating stars is often non-sinusoidal and quasi-periodic --- spots move on the stellar surface and have finite lifetimes, causing stellar flux variations to slowly shift in phase. A strictly periodic sinusoid therefore cannot accurately model a rotationally modulated stellar light curve. Physical models of stellar surfaces have many drawbacks preventing effective inference, such as highly degenerate or high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we test an appropriate effective model: a Gaussian Process with a quasi-periodic covariance kernel function. This highly flexible model allows sampling of the posterior probability density function of the periodic parameter, marginalising over the other kernel hyperparameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. To test the effectiveness of this method, we infer rotation periods from 333 simulated stellar light curves, demonstrating that the Gaussian process method produces periods that are more accurate than both a sine-fitting periodogram and an autocorrelation function method. We also demonstrate that it works well on real data, by inferring rotation periods for 275 Kepler stars with previously measured periods. We provide a table of rotation periods for these 1132 Kepler objects of interest and their posterior probability density function samples. Because this method delivers posterior probability density functions, it will enable hierarchical studies involving stellar rotation, particularly those involving population modelling, such as inferring stellar ages, obliquities in exoplanet systems, or characterising star-planet interactions. The code used to implement this method is available online.},

Building on capabilities present in Spark, AXS aims to enable querying and analyzing almost arbitrarily large astronomical catalogs using familiar Python/AstroPy concepts, DataFrame APIs, and SQL statements. We achieve this by (i) adding support to Spark for efficient on-line positional cross-matching and (ii) supplying a Python library supporting commonly used operations for astronomical data analysis. To support scalable cross-matching, we develop a variant of the ZONES algorithm capable of operating in distributed, shared-nothing architecture. We couple this to a data partitioning scheme that enables fast catalog cross-matching and handles the data skew often present in deep all-sky data sets. The cross-match and other often-used functionalities are exposed to the end users through an easy-to-use Python API. We demonstrate AXS’s technical and scientific performance on Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Zwicky Transient Facility, Gaia DR2, and AllWise catalogs. Using AXS we were able to perform on-the-fly cross-match of Gaia DR2 (1.8 billion rows) and AllWise (900 million rows) data sets in ∼30 s. We discuss how cloud-ready distributed systems like AXS provide a natural way to enable comprehensive end-user analyses of large data sets such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

As part of this analysis, we introduce an iterative method based on spectral templates to perform an accurate correction of interstellar extinction of Gaia DR2 photometry, needed because of its wide photometric bandpasses. We show that the members of the MUTA display an expected increased rate of stellar activity and faster rotation rates compared with older stars, and that literature measurements of the lithium equivalent width of nine G0 to K3-type members are consistent with our age determination. We show that the present-day mass function of the MUTA is consistent with other known nearby young associations. We identify WD 0340+103 as a hot, massive white dwarf remnant of a B2 member that left its planetary nebula phase only 270,000 years ago, posing an independent age constraint of \$60\_\{-6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+8\}\$ Myr for the MUTA.},

photometry for stars in the faint regime (G{\textgreater}13). For this pilot project, we
extracted, corrected, and analysed the light curves of 16641 stars located in a
dense region centred on the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We were able to reach the
TESS magnitude T{\textasciitilde}16.5 with a photometric precision of {\textasciitilde}1 \% on the 6.5-hour
timescale; in the bright regime we were able to detect transits with depth of
{\textasciitilde}34 parts per million. We searched for variables and candidate transiting
exoplanets. Our pipeline detected one planetary candidate orbiting a main

We rely on a set of objects with well-determined parameters in the literature to train an artificial neural network to estimate parameters from the Gaia photometry of cluster members and their mean parallax. We obtain reliable parameters for 1867 clusters. Our new homogeneous catalogue confirms the relative lack of old clusters in the inner disc (with a few notable exceptions). We also quantify and discuss the variation of scale height with cluster age, and detect the Galactic warp in the distribution of old clusters. This work results in a large and homogenous cluster catalogue.

	abstract = {We examine how tides, stellar evolution, and magnetic braking shape the rotation period (P rot) evolution of low-mass stellar binaries up to orbital periods (P orb) of 100 days across a wide range of tidal dissipation parameters using two common equilibrium tidal models. We find that many binaries with P orb ≲ 20 days tidally lock, and most with P orb ≲ 4 days tidally lock into synchronous rotation on circularized orbits. At short P orb, tidal torques produce a population of fast rotators that single-star-only models of magnetic braking fail to produce. In many cases, we show that the competition between magnetic braking and tides produces a population of subsynchronous rotators that persists for 1 Gyr, even in short-P orb binaries, qualitatively reproducing the subsynchronous eclipsing binaries discovered in the Kepler field by Lurie et al. Both equilibrium tidal models predict that binaries can tidally interact out to P orb ≈ 80 days, while the constant phase lag tidal model predicts that binaries can tidally lock out to P orb ≈ 100 days. Tidal torques often force the P rot evolution of stellar binaries to depart from the long-term magnetic-braking-driven spin-down experienced by single stars, revealing that P rot is not a valid proxy for age in all cases, i.e., gyrochronology can underpredict ages by up to 300\% unless one accounts for binarity. We suggest that accurate determinations of orbital eccentricties and P rot can be used to discriminate between which equilibrium tidal models best describe tidal interactions in low-mass binary stars.},

While several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this alignment, to date, a theoretical model that can successfully account for the observations remains elusive. In this work we show that the orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects cluster not only in argument of perihelion, but also in physical space. We demonstrate that the perihelion positions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly confined and that such a clustering has only a probability of 0.007\% to be due to chance, thus requiring a dynamical origin. We find that the observed orbital alignment can be maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass greater than {\textasciitilde}10 Earth masses, whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the distant Kuiper belt objects, but whose perihelion is 180 degrees away from the perihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed orbital alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally explains the presence of high perihelion Sedna-like objects, as well as the known collection of high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60 and 150 degrees whose origin was previously unclear. Continued analysis of both distant and highly inclined outer solar system objects provides the opportunity for testing our hypothesis as well as further constraining the orbital elements and mass of the distant planet.},

Comparison of these models with observations in various colour-magnitude diagrams for various ages shows signiﬁcant improvement over previous generations of models. The new models can solve ﬂaws that are present in the previous ones, such as the prediction of optical colours that are too blue compared to M dwarf observations. They can also reproduce the four components of the young quadruple system LkCa 3 in a colour–magnitude diagram with one single isochrone, in contrast to any presently existing model.

Unlike their tighter counterparts, the stellar orbits of wide binaries continually change under the influence of the Galactic tide and impulses from other passing stars. Here we report numerical simulations demonstrating that the variable nature of wide binary star orbits dramatically reshapes the planetary systems they host, typically Gyrs after formation. Contrary to previous understanding, wide binary companions may often strongly perturb planetary systems, triggering planetary ejections and exciting orbital eccentricities of surviving planets. Indeed, observed exoplanet eccentricities offer evidence of this; giant exoplanet orbits within wide binaries are statistically more eccentric than those around isolated stars. Both eccentricity distributions are well-reproduced when we assume isolated stars and wide binaries host similar planetary systems whose outermost giant planets are scattered beyond {\textasciitilde}10 AU from their parent stars via early internal instabilities. Consequently, our results suggest that although wide binaries eventually truncate their planetary systems, most isolated giant exoplanet systems harbor additional distant, still undetected planets.},

With finer semi-major axis bins, we detect a statistically significant warp in the mean plane near semi-major axes 40--42{\textasciitilde}au. Linear secular theory predicts a warp near this location due to the \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{18\}\$ nodal secular resonance, however the measured mean plane for the 40.3-42{\textasciitilde}au semi-major axis bin (just outside the \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{18\}\$) is inclined \${\textbackslash}sim13{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ to the predicted plane, a nearly 3-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ discrepancy. For the more distant Kuiper belt objects of semi-major axes in the range 50--80{\textasciitilde}au, the expected mean plane is close to the invariable plane of the solar system, but the measured mean plane deviates greatly from this: it has inclination \$i\_m=9.1{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$\${\textasciicircum}\{+6.6{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\}\_\{-3.8{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\}\$ and longitude of ascending node \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m=227{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$\${\textasciicircum}\{+18{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\}\_\{-44{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\}\$. We estimate this deviation from the expected mean plane to be statistically significant at the \${\textbackslash}sim97-99{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence level. We discuss several possible explanations for this deviation, including the possibility that a relatively close-in (\$a{\textbackslash}lesssim100\${\textasciitilde}au), unseen small planetary-mass object in the outer solar system is responsible for the warping.},

Here we report new spectroscopic observations of the G type, detached eclipsing binary EPIC 219394517 in the open cluster Ruprecht 147 ([Fe/H] = +0.10), which was observed in late 2015 by the K2 mission. A joint analysis of our radial-velocity measurements and the K2 light curve shows the 6.5 day orbit to be very nearly circular. We derive highly precise masses of 1.0782 +/- 0.0019 Msun and 1.0661 (+0.0027/-0.0021) Msun, radii of 1.055 +/- 0.011 Rsun and 1.042 +/- 0.012 Rsun, and effective temperatures of 5930 +/- 100 K and 5880 +/- 100 K for the primary and secondary, respectively. The distance we infer, 283 (+18/-16) pc, corresponds to a parallax in good agreement with the Gaia/DR2 value for the star. Current stellar evolution models from the MIST and PARSEC series match the above physical properties very well at ages of 2.48 and 2.65 Gyr. Isochrones for these same ages and the measured composition, along with our reddening estimate for EPIC 219394517, also show generally good agreement with the optical and near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams of the cluster, which can be constructed with no free parameters as the distances of all member stars are known from Gaia.},

The orbital periods of all three systems are \${\textless}\$5 days. We use the \$K2\$ photometry plus multiple Keck/HIRES radial velocities and spectroscopic flux ratios to determine fundamental stellar parameters for both the primary and secondary components of each system, along with the orbital parameters. We present tentative evidence that EPIC 203868608 is a hierarchical triple system comprised of an eclipsing pair of \${\textbackslash}sim\$25 \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Jup\}\$ brown dwarfs with a wide M-type companion. If confirmed, it would constitute only the second double-lined eclipsing brown dwarf binary system discovered to date. The double-lined system EPIC 203710387 is composed of nearly identical M4.5-M5 stars with fundamentally determined masses and radii measured to better than 3\% precision (\$M\_1=0.1183{\textbackslash}pm0.0028 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, \$M\_2=0.1076{\textbackslash}pm0.0031 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$R\_1=0.417{\textbackslash}pm0.010 R\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, \$R\_2=0.450{\textbackslash}pm0.012 R\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) from combination of the light curve and radial velocity time series. These stars have the lowest masses of any stellar mass double-lined eclipsing binary to date. Finally, EPIC 203476597 is a compact single-lined system with a G8-KO primary and a likely mid-K secondary whose line are revealed in spectral ratios. Continued measurement of radial velocities and spectroscopic flux ratios will better constrain fundamental parameters and should elevate the objects to benchmark status. We also present revised parameters for the double-lined eclipsing binary UScoCTIO 5 (\$M\_1=0.3336{\textbackslash}pm0.0022 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, \$M\_2=0.3200{\textbackslash}pm0.0022 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$R\_1=0.862{\textbackslash}pm0.012\$, \$R\_2=0.852{\textbackslash}pm0.013 R\_{\textbackslash}odot\$).

Based on our modeling results, we announce two new low mass (\$M\_\{tot\} {\textless} 0.6 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) EBs among Pleiades members (HCG 76 and MHO 9) and we report on two previously known Pleiades binaries that are also found to be EB systems (HII 2407 and HD 23642). We measured the masses of the binary HCG 76 to \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$2.5\% precision, and the radii to \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$4.5\% precision, which together with the precise effective temperatures yield an independent Pleiades distance of 132\${\textbackslash}pm\$5 pc. We discuss another EB towards the Pleiades that is a possible but unlikely Pleiades cluster member (AK II 465). The two new confirmed Pleiades systems extend the mass range of Pleiades EB components to 0.2-2 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Our initial measurements of the fundamental stellar parameters for the Pleiades EBs are discussed in the context of the current stellar models and the nominal cluster isochrone, finding good agreement with the stellar models of Baraffe et al. (2015) at the nominal Pleiades age of 120 Myr. Finally, in the Hyades, we report a new low mass eclipsing system (vA 50) that was concurrently discovered and studied by Mann et al. (2016). We confirm that the eclipse is likely caused by a Neptune-sized transiting planet, and with the additional radial velocity constraints presented here we improve the constraint on the maximum mass of the planet to be \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$1.2 \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Jup\}\$.},

All binaries are members of the open clusters M35 (NGC 2168; \$150 Myr) and M34 (NGC 1039; \$250 Myr). The binary orbital parameters and the rotation periods of the primary stars were determined from time-series spectroscopy and time-series photometry, respectively. Knowledge of the ages, orbital periods, and eccentricities of these binaries combined with the rotation periods and masses of their primary stars makes them particularly interesting systems for studying the rates of tidal circularization and synchronization. Our sample of 13 binaries includes six with orbital periods shortward of 13 days (a P 0:12 AU). The stars in these binaries orbit sufﬁciently close that their spins and orbits have evolved toward synchronization and circularization due to tidal interactions. We investigate the degree of tidal synchronization in each binary by comparing the angular rotation velocity of the primary stars (
?) to the angular velocity expected if the primary star was synchronized (e ¼ 0) or pseudosynchronized (e {\textgreater} 0) with the orbital motion (
ps). Of the six closest binaries, two with circular orbits are not synchronized, one being subsynchronous and one being supersynchronous, and the primary stars in two binaries with eccentric orbits are rotating more slowly than pseudosynchronism. The remaining two binaries have reached the equilibrium state of both a circularized orbit and synchronized rotation. As a set, the six binaries present a challenging case study for tidal evolution theory, which in particular does not predict subsynchronous rotation in such close systems.},

But with the discovery of two young brown dwarfs in an eclipsing binary system in the Orion Nebula star-forming region, it has been possible to measure the mass and radius of two in one go. Surprisingly, the less-massive brown dwarf is the hotter of the pair; a finding that runs contrary to the predictions of all current theoretical models of coeval brown dwarfs.

Our aim is to establish the origin of the structure reported in particular, in the \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}-z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ space. To this end, we compute the orbital parameters and frequencies of stars for a generic and for a St{\textbackslash}"ackel Milky Way potential. We find that for both the thick disc and halo populations very similar prominent substructures are apparent for the generic Galactic potential, while no substructure is seen for the St{\textbackslash}"ackel model. This indicates that the origin of these features is not merger-related, but due to non-integrability of the generic potential. This conclusion is strengthened by our frequency analysis of the orbits of stars, which reveals the presence of prominent resonances, with \${\textbackslash}sim 30{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the halo stars associated to resonance families. In fact, the stars in resonances define the substructures seen in the spaces of characteristic orbital parameters. Furthermore, we find that some stars in our sample and in debris streams are on the same resonance as the Sagittarius dwarf, suggesting this system has also influenced the distribution of stars in the Galactic thick disc and halo components. Our study constitutes a step towards disentangling the imprint of merger debris from substructures driven by internal dynamics. Given their prominence, these resonant-driven overdensities could potentially be useful to constrain the exact form of the Galactic potential.},

	abstract = {At least \$70{\textbackslash}\%\$ of massive OBA-type stars reside in binary or higher-order systems. The dynamical evolution of these systems can lend insight into the origins of extreme phenomena such as X-ray binaries and gravitational wave sources. In one such dynamical process, the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) Mechanism, a third companion star alters the secular evolution of a binary system. For dynamical stability, these triple systems must have a hierarchical configuration. We explore the effects of a distant third companion's gravitational perturbations on a massive binary's orbital configuration before significant stellar evolution has taken place (\${\textbackslash}leq 10\$ Myr). We include tidal dissipation and general relativistic precession. With large (\$38,000\$ total) Monte-Carlo realizations of massive hierarchical triples, we characterize imprints of the birth conditions on the final orbital distributions. Specifically, we find that the final eccentricity distribution over the range \$0.1-0.7\$ is an excellent indicator of its birth distribution. Furthermore, we find that the period distributions have a similar mapping for wide orbits. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed period distribution for approximately \$10\$ Myr-old massive stars is consistent with EKL evolution.},

	abstract = {Accurate stellar parameters of stars in open clusters can help constrain models of stellar structure and evolution. Here we wish to determine the age and metallicity content of the open cluster NGC 2506. To this end we investigated three detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs; V2032, V4, and V5) for which we determined their masses and radii, as well as four red giant branch stars for which we determined their effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities. Three of the stars in the DEBs have masses close to the cluster turn-off mass, allowing for extremely precise age determination. Comparing the values for the masses and radii of the binaries to BaSTI isochrones we estimated a cluster age of \$2.01 {\textbackslash}pm 0.10\$ Gyr. This does depend on the models used in the comparison, where we have found that the inclusion of convective core-overshooting is necessary to properly model the cluster. From red giant branch stars we determined values for the effective temperatures, the surface gravities, and the metallicities. From these we find a cluster metallicity of \$-0.36 {\textbackslash}pm 0.10\$ dex. Using this value and the values for the effective temperatures we determine the reddening to be E\$(b - y) = 0.057 {\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$ mag. Furthermore, we derived the distance to the cluster from Gaia parallaxes and found \$3.101 {\textbackslash}pm 0.017\$ kpc, and we have performed a radial velocity membership determination for stars in the field of the cluster. Finally, we report on the detection of oscillation signals in \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ Dor and \${\textbackslash}delta\$ Scuti members in data from the TESS mission, including the possible detection of solar-like oscillations in two of the red giants.},

	abstract = {In order to understand the orbital history of Galactic halo objects, such as globular clusters, authors usually assume a static potential for our Galaxy with parameters that appear at the present day. According to the standard paradigm of galaxy formation, galaxies grow through a continuous accretion of fresh gas and a hierarchical merging with smaller galaxies from high redshift to the present day. This implies that the mass and size of disc, bulge, and halo change with time. We investigate the effect of assuming a live Galactic potential on the orbital history of halo objects and its consequences on their internal evolution. We numerically integrate backwards the equations of motion of different test objects located in different Galactocentric distances in both static and time-dependent Galactic potentials in order to see if it is possible to discriminate between them. We show that in a live potential, the birth of the objects, 13 Gyr ago, would have occurred at signiﬁcantly larger Galactocentric distances, compared to the objects orbiting in a static potential. Based on the direct N-body calculations of star clusters carried out with collisional N-body code, NBODY6, we also discuss the consequences of the time-dependence of a Galactic potential on the early- and long-term evolution of star clusters in a simple way, by comparing the evolution of two star clusters embedded in galactic models, which represent the galaxy at present and 12 Gyr ago, respectively. We show that assuming a static potential over a Hubble time for our Galaxy as it is often done, leads to an enhancement of mass-loss, an overestimation of the dissolution rates of globular clusters, an underestimation of the ﬁnal size of star clusters, and a shallower stellar mass function.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6015},
	abstract = {A number of problems in probability and statistics can be addressed using the multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the \$n\$-dimensional setting, however, it requires the inversion of an \$n {\textbackslash}times n\$ covariance matrix, \$C\$, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, \${\textbackslash}det(C)\$. In many cases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of the form \$C = {\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2 I + K\$, where \$K\$ is computed using a specified covariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters (hyperparameters). The matrix \$C\$ is typically dense, causing standard direct methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require \${\textbackslash}mathcal O(n{\textasciicircum}3)\$ work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix \$C\$ can be hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the identity matrix, yielding an \${\textbackslash}mathcal O (n{\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2 n) \$ algorithm for inversion. More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant \${\textbackslash}det(C)\$, permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining \$K\$. Our fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance computing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable problems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance kernels.},

The torque also contains an empirically derived scaling with stellar mass (and radius), which provides new insight into the mass-dependence of stellar magnetic and wind properties. We demonstrate that this new formulation explains why the lowest mass stars are observed to maintain rapid rotation for much longer than solar-mass stars, and simultaneously why older populations exhibit a sequence of slowly rotating stars, in which the low-mass stars rotate more slowly than solar-mass stars. The model also reproduces some previously unexplained features in the period-mass diagram for the Kepler field, notably: the particular shape of the "upper envelope" of the
distribution, suggesting that {\textasciitilde}95\% of Kepler field stars with measured rotation periods are younger than {\textasciitilde}4 Gyr; and the shape of the "lower envelope," corresponding to the location where stars transition between magnetically saturated and unsaturated regimes.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

	abstract = {We use Density Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference, \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ Cold Dark Matter simulations of \${\textbackslash}sim 2M\$ galaxy pairs, and data from Gaia and the Hubble Space Telescope to infer the sum of the masses of the Milky Way and Andromeda (M31) galaxies, the two main components of the Local Group. This method overcomes most of the approximations of the traditional timing argument, makes the writing of a theoretical likelihood unnecessary, and allows the non-linear modelling of observational errors that take into account correlations in the data and non-Gaussian distributions. We obtain an \$M\_\{200\}\$ mass estimate \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm MW+M31\} = 4.6{\textasciicircum}\{+2.3\}\_\{-1.8\} {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (\$68 {\textbackslash}\%\$ C.L.), in agreement with previous estimates both for the sum of the two masses and for the individual masses. This result is not only one of the most reliable estimates of the sum of the two masses to date, but is also an illustration of likelihood-free inference in a problem with only one parameter and only three data points.},

	abstract = {GALAH and APOGEE are two high resolution multi object spectroscopic surveys that provide fundamental stellar parameters and multiple elemental abundance estimates for \${\textgreater}\$ 400,000 stars in the Milky Way. They are complimentary in both sky coverage and wavelength regime. Thus combining the two surveys will provide us a large sample to investigate the disc metallicity and alpha abundance trends. We use the Cannon data-driven approach selecting training sets from among \${\textbackslash}sim\$20,000 stars in common for the two surveys to predict the GALAH scaled stellar parameters from APOGEE spectra as well as APOGEE scaled stellar parameters from GALAH spectra. We provide two combined catalogues with GALAH scaled and APOGEE scaled stellar parameters each having \${\textbackslash}sim\$500,000 stars after quality cuts. With \${\textbackslash}sim\$470,000 stars that are common in both these catalogues, we compare the GALAH scaled and APOGEE scaled metallicity distribution functions (MDF), radial and vertical metallicity gradients as well as the variation of [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] vs [Fe/H] trends along and away from the Galactic mid plane. We find mean metallicities of APOGEE scaled sample to be higher compared to that for the GALAH scaled sample. We find similar [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] vs [Fe/H] trends using both samples consistent with previous observational as well as simulation based studies. Radial and vertical metallicity gradients derived using the two survey scaled samples are consistent except in the inner and outer Galactocentric radius bins. Our gradient estimates in the solar neighborhood are also consistent with previous studies and are backed by larger sample size compared to previous works.},

	abstract = {Open clusters are unique tracers of the history of our own Galaxy's disk. According to our membership analysis based on {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} astrometry, out of the 226 potential clusters falling in the footprint of GALAH or APOGEE, we find that 205 have secure members that were observed by at least one of the survey. Furthermore, members of 134 clusters have high-quality spectroscopic data that we use to determine their chemical composition. We leverage this information to study the chemical distribution throughout the Galactic disk of 21 elements, from C to Eu, and including Fe. The radial metallicity gradient obtained from our analysis is \$-\$0.076\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.009 dex kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, which is in agreement with previous works based on smaller samples. Furthermore, the gradient in the [Fe/H] - guiding radius (r\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm guid\}\$) plane is \$-\$0.073\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.008 dex kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We also reveal trends in the [X/Fe] - r\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm guid\}\$ - age space, which are important to understand production rates of different elements as a function of space and time. Finally, we observe subtle - but significant - differences on how field stars and open clusters trace the distribution of chemical elements throughout the Galactic disk. As it is discussed in the paper, these differences are probably due to the physical selection effect imposed by our Galaxy, which preserves the clusters living far from its gravitational potential perturbations (e.g., spirals, bars, molecular clouds), while it destroys all the others.},

An evolving potential modifies a satellite's orbit relative to its static equivalent, though the difference is small compared to existing uncertainties on orbital parameters. We find that the UFD Bo{\textbackslash}"otes II is likely on its first passage around the Milky Way. Depending on the assumed mass of the Milky Way, the UFDs Triangulum II, Hydrus I, Coma Berenices, Draco II, and Ursa Major II, as well as the GC Pyxis, may also be on first infall so may be useful for constraining the mass of the Galaxy. We identify a clear kinematic distinction between metal-rich (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H]\}{\textgreater}-1.1\$) and metal-poor GCs (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H]\}{\textbackslash}leq-1.1\$). Although most metal-rich clusters occupy predominately prograde orbits, with low eccentricities (\$e{\textbackslash}approx 0.35\$) and similar specific angular momenta and orbital planes as the Galactic disc, 7 show potentially retrograde orbits, the origin of which is unclear. Metal-poor clusters have more diverse orbits, higher eccentricities (\$e{\textbackslash}approx 0.65\$), and half of them have orbital planes offset from the disc by 60 to 120 degrees---twice as many as the metal-poor GCs. The UFDs have similar \${\textbackslash}theta\$ and \${\textbackslash}phi\$ to the metal-poor GCs, suggesting a similar origin. We provide a catalogue of orbital parameters for UFDs and GCs for two different Galaxy masses and their observational uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Flattened axisymmetric galactic potentials are known to host minor orbit families surrounding orbits with commensurable frequencies. The behavior of orbits that belong to these orbit families is fundamentally different than that of typical orbits with non-commensurable frequencies. We investigate the evolution of stellar streams on orbits near the boundaries between orbit families (separatrices) in a flattened axisymmetric potential. We demonstrate that the separatrix divides these streams into two groups of stars that belong to two different orbit families, and that as a result, these streams diffuse more rapidly than streams that evolve elsewhere in the potential. We utilize Hamiltonian perturbation theory to estimate both the timescale of this effect and the likelihood of a stream evolving close enough to a separatrix to be affected by it. We analyze two prior reports of stream-fanning in simulations with triaxial potentials, and conclude that at least one of them is caused by separatrix divergence. These results lay the foundation for a method of mapping the orbit families of galactic potentials using the morphology of stellar streams. Comparing these predictions with the currently known distribution of streams in the Milky Way presents a new way of constraining the shape of our Galaxy's potential and distribution of dark matter.},

	abstract = {Using N-body simulations of the Milky Way interacting with a satellite similar to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, we quantitatively analyse the vertical response of the Galactic disc to the satellite's repeated impacts. We approximate the vertical distortion of the Galactic disc as the sum of the first three Fourier azimuthal terms m = 0, 1 and 2, and observe their evolution in different dynamical regimes of interaction. After the first interaction, the m=0 term manifests itself as outgoing ring-like vertical distortions. The m=1 term (S-shape warp) is prograde when the impacts of the satellite are more frequent, or in general close to an interaction, whereas it is slowly retrograde in the most quiescent phases. The m=2 term is typically prograde, and close to an interaction it couples with the m=1 term. Finally, we find that the vertical response of the disc can be recovered in an unbiased way using the instantaneous positions and velocities of stars in a limited volume of the Galactic disc, analogous to real data, and that the measured vertical pattern speeds have a constraining power in the context of a Milky Way-satellite interaction.},

	abstract = {The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) surveys have initially been optimized to omit the inner part of the Milky Way disk/bar from deep and cadence observations. However it is now clear that the LSST will be powerful for Galactic astronomy and may play a crucial role in continuing to extend the Gaia astrometric catalog until a future satellite, either optical or IR, carries on. LSST will provide metallicities and kinematics for the bulge, and will map halo structures to as distant as 450 kpc, nearly half the distance to the Andromeda galaxy. Thanks to the unprecedented calibration eﬀort for its photometric system, and surprisingly good astrometry (transverse velocity measurements of 0.2 mas/yr at r=21; 1 mas/yr at r=24) LSST will provide photometric abundances and distance constraints for a billion or more Milky Way stars to distances of 450 kpc, and kinematics from proper motions to ∼ 100 kpc. Single observation depths reach ∼ 24 in the ugrizy bands, while depths at end of mission reach ∼ 27. Although halo structures such as streams and dwarf galaxies are initially identiﬁed by the RR Lyrae and giants, their structure will be ﬂeshed out by the 100× more abundant dwarfs that will be detected to 100 kpc (single observation) and ∼ 300 kpc by end of mission. More complete mapping of stream structures may constrain the mass distribution of dark matter and perhaps conﬁrm the interaction of dark matter halos and streams. I also describe the Blanco DECam Bulge Survey, a 200 deg2 LSST pathﬁnder survey of the bulge in ugrizy using the Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco 4m telescope. The purpose of this article is to encourage active workers on the Milky Way and Local Volume to participate in the LSST project, in particular to urge that the Galactic Plane receive the same cadence and depth coverage as the rest of the extragalactic sky.},

However, the likelihood of a stellar density with respect to the stream and subhaloes parameters involves solving an intractable inverse problem which rests on the integration of all possible forward realisations implicitly defined by the simulation model. In order to infer the subhalo abundance, previous analyses have relied on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) together with domain-motivated but handcrafted summary statistics. Here, we introduce a likelihood-free Bayesian inference pipeline based on Amortised Approximate Likelihood Ratios (AALR), which automatically learns a mapping between the data and the simulator parameters and obviates the need to handcraft a possibly insufficient summary statistic. We apply the method to the simplified case where stellar streams are only perturbed by dark matter subhaloes, thus neglecting baryonic substructures, and describe several diagnostics that demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method and the statistical quality of the learned estimator.},

	abstract = {The traditional Chandrasekhar picture of the slow relaxation of stellar systems assumes that stars' orbits are only modified by occasional, uncorrelated, two-body flyby encounters with other stars. However, the long-range nature of gravity means that in reality large numbers of stars can behave collectively. In stable systems this collective behaviour (i) amplifies the noisy fluctuations in the system's gravitational potential, effectively 'dressing' the two-body (star-star) encounters, and (ii) allows the system to support large-scale density waves (a.k.a. normal modes) which decay through resonant wave-star interactions. If the relaxation of the system is dominated by effect (i) then it is described by the Balescu-Lenard (BL) kinetic theory. Meanwhile if (ii) dominates, one must describe relaxation using quasilinear (QL) theory, though in the stellar-dynamical context the full set of QL equations has never been presented. Moreover, in some systems like open clusters and galactic disks, both (i) and (ii) might be important. Here we present for the first time the equations of a unified kinetic theory of stellar systems in angle-action variables that accounts for both effects (i) and (ii) simultaneously. We derive the equations in a heuristic, physically-motivated fashion and work in the simplest possible regime by accounting only for very weakly damped waves. This unified theory is effectively a superposition of BL and QL theories, both of which are recovered in appropriate limits. The theory is a first step towards a comprehensive description of those stellar systems for which neither the QL or BL theory will suffice.},

	abstract = {In slowly evolving spherical potentials, \${\textbackslash}Phi(r,t)\$, radial actions are typically assumed to remain constant. Here, we construct dynamical invariants that allow us to derive the generic evolution of radial actions in spherical central potentials with an arbitrary time dependence. We show that the radial actions oscillate around a constant value with an amplitude \${\textbackslash}Delta J\_r {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}Phi\}/{\textbackslash}Phi{\textbackslash},P(E,L)\$, where \$P\$ is the radial period of an orbit with energy \$E\$ and angular momentum \$L\$. Using this result, we develop a diffusion theory that describes the evolution of the radial action distribution of ensembles of tracer particles orbiting in time-dependent spherical potentials. Tests against restricted \$N\$-body simulations in a varying Keplerian potential indicate that our linear theory is accurate in regions of phase-space in which the diffusion coefficient \${\textbackslash}tilde\{D\}(J\_r) {\textless} 0.01{\textbackslash},J\_r{\textasciicircum}2\$. For illustration, we show that i) in Milky Way (MW) dark matter haloes with a median mass accretion history only \${\textbackslash}sim 40\$ per cent of halo particles evolve within the linear regime since the redshift of maximum accretion, which calls against using radial actions as `adiabatic invariants' when attempting to theoretically predict the density profiles of DM haloes, or construct models for tidal streams in action-angle space. ii) In contrast, the cusp-core transformation of dwarf haloes in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models (with \${\textbackslash}sigma/m\_{\textbackslash}chi = 1{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}2g{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$) leads to haloes in which more than \${\textbackslash}sim 97\$ per cent of DM particles exhibit a linear behaviour of radial actions. We conclude that the radial action distribution of stellar tracers in SIDM haloes is hardly affected by self-collisions in the dark sector.},

	abstract = {Many approaches to galaxy dynamics assume that the gravitational potential is simple and the distribution function is time-invariant. Under these assumptions there are traditional tools for inferring potential parameters given observations of stellar kinematics (e.g., Jeans models). However, spectroscopic surveys measure many stellar properties beyond kinematics. Here we present a new approach for dynamical inference, Orbital Torus Imaging, which makes use of kinematic measurements and element abundances (or other invariant labels). We exploit the fact that, in steady state, stellar labels vary systematically with orbit characteristics (actions), yet must be invariant with respect to orbital phases (conjugate angles). The orbital foliation of phase space must therefore coincide with surfaces along which all moments of all stellar label distributions are constant. Both classical-statistics and Bayesian methods can be built on this; these methods will be more robust and require fewer assumptions than traditional tools because they require no knowledge of the (spatial) survey selection function and they do not involve second moments of velocity distributions. We perform a classical-statistics demonstration with red giant branch stars from the APOGEE surveys: We model the vertical orbit structure in the Milky Way disk to constrain the local disk mass, scale height, and the disk--halo mass ratio (at fixed local circular velocity).

Our method samples from the full probability density function of distance, reddening, and stellar type for individual stars, as well as the full uncertainty in reddening as a function of distance in the 3D dust map. We incorporate prior knowledge of the distribution of stars in the Galaxy and the detection limits of the survey. For stars in the Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) 3π survey, we demonstrate that our reddening estimates are unbiased and accurate to ∼0.13 mag in E(B − V ) for the typical star. Based on comparisons with mock catalogs, we expect distances for main-sequence stars to be constrained to within ∼20\%–60\%, although this range can vary, depending on the reddening of the star, the precise stellar type, and its position on the sky. A later paper will present a 3D map of dust over the three quarters of the sky surveyed by PS1. Both the individual stellar inferences and the 3D dust map will enable a wealth of Galactic science in the plane. The method we present is not limited to the passbands of the PS1 survey but may be extended to incorporate photometry from other surveys, such as the Two Micron All Sky Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (where available), and in the future, LSST and Gaia.},

Our approach uses the extinction measured towards stars at diﬀerent locations in the Galaxy at approximately known distances. Each extinction measurement is proportional to the integrated dust density along its line of sight (LoS). Making simple assumptions about the spatial correlation of the dust density, we can infer the most probable 3D distribution of dust across the entire observed region, including along sight lines which were not observed. This is possible because our model employs a Gaussian process to connect all LoS. We demonstrate the capability of our model to capture detailed dust density variations using mock data and simulated data from the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot. We then apply our method to a sample of giant stars observed by APOGEE and Kepler to construct a 3D dust map over a small region of the Galaxy. Owing to our smoothness constraint and its isotropy, we provide one of the ﬁrst maps which does not show the “ﬁngers of God” eﬀect.},

This map covers the sky north of a decl. of −30°, out to a distance of a few kiloparsecs. This new map contains three major improvements over our previous work. First, the inclusion of Gaia parallaxes dramatically improves distance estimates to nearby stars. Second, we incorporate a spatial prior that correlates the dust density across nearby sightlines. This produces a smoother map, with more isotropic clouds and smaller distance uncertainties, particularly to clouds within the nearest kiloparsec. Third, we infer the dust density with a distance resolution that is four times finer than in our previous work, to accommodate the improvements in signal-to-noise enabled by the other improvements. As part of this work, we infer the distances, reddenings, and types of 799 million stars.

More information about the map, as well as an interactive viewer, can be found at argonaut.skymaps.info.)

	abstract = {We estimate the 3D density profile of the Galactic dark matter (DM) halo within \$r {\textbackslash}lesssim 30\$ kpc from the Galactic centre by using the astrometric data for halo RR Lyrae stars from Gaia DR2. We model both the stellar halo distribution function and the Galactic potential, fully taking into account the survey selection function, the observational errors, and the missing line-of-sight velocity data for RR Lyrae stars. With a Bayesian MCMC method, we infer the model parameters, including the density flattening of the DM halo \$q\$, which is assumed to be constant as a function of radius. We find that 99{\textbackslash}\% of the posterior distribution of \$q\$ is located at \$q{\textgreater}0.963\$, which strongly disfavours a flattened DM halo. We cannot draw any conclusions as to whether the Galactic DM halo at \$r {\textbackslash}lesssim 30\$ kpc is prolate, because we restrict ourselves to axisymmetric oblate halo models with \$q{\textbackslash}leq1\$. Our result is inconsistent with predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that advocate more oblate (\${\textbackslash}langle\{q\}{\textbackslash}rangle {\textbackslash}sim0.8 {\textbackslash}pm 0.15\$) DM halos within \${\textbackslash}sim 15{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the virial radius for Milky-Way-sized galaxies. An alternative possibility, based on our validation tests with a cosmological simulation, is that the true value \$q\$ of the Galactic halo could be consistent with cosmological simulations but that disequilibrium in the Milky Way potential is inflating our measurement of \$q\$ by 0.1-0.2. As a by-product of our analysis, our model constrains the DM density in the Solar neighbourhood to be \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{DM\},{\textbackslash}odot\} = (9.01{\textasciicircum}\{+0.18\}\_\{-0.20\}){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} = 0.342{\textasciicircum}\{+0.007\}\_\{-0.007\}\$ \${\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GeV\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$.},

	abstract = {Theoretical models of stellar evolution predict that most of the lithium inside a star is destroyed as the star becomes a red giant. However, observations reveal that about 1\% of red giants are peculiarly rich in lithium, often exceeding the amount in the interstellar medium or predicted from the Big Bang. With only about 150 lithium-rich giants discovered in the past four decades, and no distinguishing properties other than lithium enhancement, the origin of lithium-rich giant stars is one of the oldest problems in stellar astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of 2,330 low-mass (1 to 3\${\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) lithium-rich giant stars, which we argue are consistent with internal lithium production that is driven by tidal spin-up by a binary companion. Our sample reveals that most lithium-rich giants have helium-burning cores (\$80{\textasciicircum}\{+7\}\_\{-6\}{\textbackslash}\%\$), and that the frequency of lithium-rich giants rises with increasing stellar metallicity. We find that while planet accretion may explain some lithium-rich giants, it cannot account for the majority that have helium-burning cores. We rule out most other proposed explanations as the primary mechanism for lithium-rich giants, including all stages related to single star evolution. Our analysis shows that giants remain lithium-rich for only about two million years. A prediction from this lithium depletion timescale is that most lithium-rich giants with a helium-burning core have a binary companion.},

Here we present extensive VICJHKS light curves (LCs) spanning ∼15 yr, as well as a Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) optical spectrum. The LCs evince a third light source that is variable with a period of 0.73 days, and is also manifested in the high-resolution spectrum, strongly indicating the presence of a third star in the system, probably a rapidly rotating Classical T Tauri star. We incorporate this third light into our radial velocity and LC modeling of the eclipsing pair, measuring accurate masses (M1 = 0.391 ± 0.032 and M2 = 0.385 ± 0.032 M ), radii (R1 = 1.73 ± 0.02 and R2 = 1.62 ± 0.02 R ), and temperature ratio (Teff,1/Teff,2 = 1.0924 ± 0.0017). Thus, the radii of the eclipsing stars differ by 6.9\% ± 0.8\%, the temperatures differ by 9.2\% ± 0.2\%, and consequently the luminosities differ by 62\% ± 3\%, despite having masses equal to within 3\%. This could be indicative of an age difference of ∼3 × 105 yr between the two eclipsing stars, perhaps a vestige of the binary formation history. We ﬁnd that the eclipsing pair is in an orbit that has not yet fully circularized, e = 0.0166 ± 0.003. In addition, we measure the rotation rate of the eclipsing stars to be 4.629 ± 0.006 days; they rotate slightly faster than their 4.674 day orbit. The non-zero eccentricity and super-synchronous rotation suggest that the eclipsing pair should be tidally interacting, so we calculate the tidal history of the system according to different tidal evolution theories. We ﬁnd that tidal heating effects can explain the observed luminosity difference of the eclipsing pair, providing an alternative to the previously suggested age difference.},

Eclipsing M dwarfs that orbit solar-type stars (EBLMs), like J0113+31, have been identiﬁed from their light curves and follow-up spectroscopy in the course of the WASP transiting planet search. We present the analysis of the ﬁrst binary of the EBLM sample for which masses, radii and temperatures of both components are derived, and thus, deﬁne here the methodology. The primary component with a mass of 0.945 ± 0.045 M has a large radius (1.378 ± 0.058 R ) indicating that the system is quite old, ∼9.5 Gyr. The M-dwarf secondary mass of 0.186 ± 0.010 M and radius of 0.209 ± 0.011 R are fully consistent with stellar evolutionary models. However, from the near-infrared secondary eclipse light curve, the M dwarf is found to have an eﬀective temperature of 3922 ± 42 K, which is ∼600 K hotter than predicted by theoretical models. We discuss diﬀerent scenarios to explain this temperature discrepancy. The case of J0113+31 for which we can measure mass, radius, temperature, and metallicity highlights the importance of deriving mass, radius, and temperature as a function of metallicity for M dwarfs to better understand the lowest mass stars. The EBLM Project will deﬁne the relationship between mass, radius, temperature, and metallicity for M dwarfs providing important empirical constraints at the bottom of the main sequence.},

	abstract = {In clustered environments, stellar encounters can liberate planets from their host stars via close encounters. Although the detection probability of planets suggests that the planet population in open clusters resembles that in the field, only a few dozen planet-hosting stars have been discovered in open clusters. We explore the survival rates of planets against stellar encounters in open clusters similar to the Pleiades, Hyades, and Praesepe and embedded clusters. We performed a series of N-body simulations of high-density and low-density open clusters, open clusters that grow via mergers of subclusters, and embedded clusters. We semi-analytically calculated the survival rate of planets in star clusters up to 1Gyr using relative velocities, masses, and impact parameters of intruding stars. Less than 1.5\% of close-in planets within 1 AU and at most 7\% of planets with 1-10 AU are ejected by stellar encounters in clustered environments after the dynamical evolution of star clusters. If a planet population from 0.01-100 AU in an open cluster initially follows the probability distribution function of exoplanets with semi-major axis (\$a\_p\$) between 0.03-3 AU in the field discovered by RV surveys, the PDF of surviving planets beyond {\textasciitilde}10 AU in open clusters can be slightly modified to \${\textbackslash}propto a\_p{\textasciicircum}\{-0.76\}\$. The production rate of free-floating planets (FFPs) per star is 0.0096-0.18, where we have assumed that all the stars initially have one giant planet with a mass of 1--13 MJ in a circular orbit. The expected frequency of FFPs is compatible with the upper limit on that of FFPs indicated by recent microlensing surveys. Our survival rates of planets in open clusters suggest that planets within 10 AU around FGKM-type stars are rich in relatively-young ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}10-100 Myr for open clusters and {\textasciitilde}1-10 Myr for embedded clusters), less massive open clusters, which are promising targets for planet searches.},

For example, if heating rates on an exoplanet are near or greater than that on Io (where tides drive volcanism that resurfaces the planet at least every 1 Myr) and produce similar surface conditions, then the development of life seems unlikely. On the other hand, if the tidal heating rate is less than the minimum to initiate plate tectonics, then CO2 may not be recycled through subduction, leading to a runaway greenhouse that sterilizes the planet. These two cases represent potential boundaries to habitability and are presented along with the range of the traditional HZ for main-sequence, low-mass stars. We propose a revised HZ that incorporates both stellar insolation and tidal heating. We apply these criteria to GJ 581 d and find that it is in the traditional HZ, but its tidal heating alone may be insufficient for plate tectonics.},

	abstract = {The nature of the spiral structure of the Milky Way has long been debated. Only in the last decade have astronomers been able to accurately measure distances to a substantial number of high-mass star-forming regions, the classic tracers of spiral structure in galaxies. We report distance measurements at radio wavelengths using the Very Long Baseline Array for eight regions of massive star formation near the Local spiral arm of the Milky Way. Combined with previous measurements, these observations reveal that the Local Arm is larger than previously thought, and both its pitch angle and star formation rate are comparable to those of the Galaxy's major spiral arms, such as Sagittarius and Perseus. Toward the constellation Cygnus, sources in the Local Arm extend for a great distance along our line of sight and roughly along the solar orbit. Because of this orientation, these sources cluster both on the sky and in velocity to form the complex and long enigmatic Cygnus X region. We also identify a spur that branches between the Local and Sagittarius spiral arms.},

	abstract = {This report is a review of Darwin’s classical theory of bodily tides in which we present the analytical expressions for the orbital and rotational evolution of the bodies and for the energy dissipation rates due to their tidal interaction. General formulas are given which do not depend on any assumption linking the tidal lags to the frequencies of the corresponding tidal waves (except that equal frequency harmonics are assumed to span equal lags). Emphasis is given to the cases of companions having reached one of the two possible ﬁnal states: (1) the super-synchronous stationary rotation resulting from the vanishing of the average tidal torque; (2) capture into the 1:1 spin-orbit resonance (true synchronization). In these cases, the energy dissipation is controlled by the tidal harmonic with period equal to the orbital period (instead of the semi-diurnal tide) and the singularity due to the vanishing of the geometric phase lag does not exist. It is also shown that the true synchronization with non-zero eccentricity is only possible if an extra torque exists opposite to the tidal torque. The theory is developed assuming that this additional torque is produced by an equatorial permanent asymmetry in the companion. The results are model-dependent and the theory is developed only to the second degree in eccentricity and inclination (obliquity). It can easily be extended to higher orders, but formal accuracy will not be a real improvement as long as the physics of the processes leading to tidal lags is not better known.},

An elementary derivation is presented of the perturbing tidal forces, and the perturbations are used to derive differential equations for the evolution of several orbital and
rotational parameters of the binary system. Energy and angular momentum considerations are used directly instead of the general perturbation techniques of celestial mechanics. The tidal evolution equations are analyzed locally around equilibrium configurations. Time scales are derived for the rate of change of the semimajor axis, the rotational velocity, and for the eccentricity and inclination, which go to zero asymptotically. The global aspects of the tidal evolution equations are analyzed. For the case of small inclinations but arbitrary eccentricity, a complete classification is made of all types of tidal evolution possible in the model which is presented. Several relations are obtained analytically from the equations for tidal evolution in the weak friction model. The presented model is simple, but it is sufficiently general to be applicable to a wide class of binary stars},

Targets primarily have distances within 20 pc of the Sun, with more distant sources selected for their unusual spectral energy distributions. We achieved precisions of 2–3 km s−1, and combined these with astrometric and spectrophotometric data to calculate UVW velocities. Most are members of the thin disk of the Galaxy, and velocity dispersions indicate a mean age of 5.2 ± 0.2 Gyr for sources within 20 pc. We find signficantly different kinematic ages between late-M dwarfs (4.0 ± 0.2 Gyr) and L dwarfs (6.5 ± 0.4 Gyr) in our sample that are contrary to predictions from prior simulations. This difference appears to be driven by a dispersed population of unusually blue L dwarfs which may be more prevalent in our local volume-limited sample than in deeper magnitude-limited surveys. The L dwarfs exhibit an asymmetric U velocity distribution with a net inward flow, similar to gradients recently detected in local stellar samples. Simulations incorporating brown dwarf evolution and Galactic orbital dynamics are unable to reproduce the velocity asymmetry, suggesting non-axisymmetric perturbations or two distinct L dwarf populations. We also find the L dwarfs to have a kinematic age-activity correlation similar to more massive stars. We identify several sources with low surface gravities, and two new substellar candidate members of nearby young moving groups: the astrometric binary DENIS J08230313–4912012AB, a low-probability member of the β Pictoris Moving Group; and 2MASS J15104786–2818174, a moderate-probability member of the 30–50 Myr Argus Association.},

	abstract = {In the 20+ years of Doppler observations of stars, scientists have uncovered a diverse population of extrasolar multi-planet systems. A common technique for characterizing the orbital elements of these planets is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), using a Keplerian model with random walk proposals and paired with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. For approximately a couple of dozen planetary systems with Doppler observations, there are strong planet-planet interactions due to the system being in or near a mean-motion resonance (MMR). An N-body model is often required to accurately describe these systems. Further computational difficulties arise from exploring a high-dimensional parameter space (\${\textbackslash}sim\$7 x number of planets) that can have complex parameter correlations. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a differential evolution MCMC (DEMCMC) applied to radial velocity data while incorporating self-consistent N-body integrations. Our Radial velocity Using N-body DEMCMC (RUN DMC) algorithm improves upon the random walk proposal distribution of the traditional MCMC by using an ensemble of Markov chains to adaptively improve the proposal distribution. We describe the methodology behind the algorithm, along with results of tests for accuracy and performance. We find that most algorithm parameters have a modest effect on the rate of convergence. However, the size of the ensemble can have a strong effect on performance. We show that the optimal choice depends on the number of planets in a system, as well as the computer architecture used and the resulting extent of parallelization. While the exact choices of optimal algorithm parameters will inevitably vary due to the details of individual planetary systems, we offer recommendations for choosing the DEMCMC algorithm's algorithmic parameters that result in excellent performance for a wide variety of planetary systems.},

The Payne combines a number of important methodological aspects: it exploits the information from much of the available spectral range; it fits all labels (stellar parameters and element abundances) simultaneously; it uses spectral models, where the atmosphere structure and the radiative transport are consistently calculated to reflect the stellar labels. At its core The Payne has an approach to accurate and precise interpolation and prediction of the spectrum in high-dimensional label-space, which is flexible and robust, yet based on only a moderate number of ab initio models (O(1000) for 25 labels). With a simple neural-net-like functional form and a suitable choice of training labels, this interpolation yields a spectral flux prediction good to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ rms across a wide range of \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ and log g (including dwarfs and giants). We illustrate the power of this approach by applying it to the APOGEE DR14 data set, drawing on Kurucz models with recently improved line lists: without recalibration, we obtain physically sensible stellar parameters as well as 15 element abundances that appear to be more precise than the published APOGEE DR14 values. In short, The Payne is an approach that for the first time combines all these key ingredients, necessary for progress towards optimal modelling of survey spectra; and it leads to both precise and accurate estimates of stellar labels, based on physical models and without re-calibration.

We collate empirical age constraints based on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, average density, lithium absorption, surface gravity features, metallicity, kinematics, rotation, and magnetic activity; and conclude that TRAPPIST-1 is a transitional thin/thick disk star with an age of 7.6 ± 2.2 Gyr. The star’s color–magnitude position indicates that it is slightly metal-rich, which is consistent with the previously reported near-infrared spectroscopic metallicity; and it has a radius ) that is larger by 8\%–14\% than the predictions of solar-metallicity evolutionary models.

This computationally opens up the stability-constrained characterization of multiplanet systems. Our model, trained on ∼100,000 three-planet systems sampled at discrete resonances, generalizes both to a sample spanning a continuous period-ratio range, as well as to a large five-planet sample with qualitatively different configurations to our training dataset. Our approach significantly outperforms previous methods based on systems’ angular momentum deficit, chaos indicators, and parametrized fits to numerical integrations. We use SPOCK to constrain the free eccentricities between the inner and outer pairs of planets in the Kepler-431 system of three approximately Earth-sized planets to both be below 0.05. Our stability analysis provides significantly stronger eccentricity constraints than currently achievable through either radial velocity or transit-duration measurements for small planets and within a factor of a few of systems that exhibit transit-timing variations (TTVs). Given that current exoplanet-detection strategies now rarely allow for strong TTV constraints [S. Hadden, T. Barclay, M. J. Payne, M. J. Holman, Astrophys. J. 158, 146 (2019)], SPOCK enables a powerful complementary method for precisely characterizing compact multiplanet systems. We publicly release SPOCK for community use.},

	abstract = {TRAPPIST-1 is an ultracool dwarf star transited by seven Earth-sized planets, for which thorough characterization of atmospheric properties, surface conditions encompassing habitability, and internal compositions is possible with current and next-generation telescopes. Accurate modeling of the star is essential to achieve this goal. We aim to obtain updated stellar parameters for TRAPPIST-1 based on new measurements and evolutionary models, compared to those used in discovery studies. We present a new measurement for the parallax of TRAPPIST-1, 82.4 ± 0.8 mas, based on 188 epochs of observations with the TRAPPIST and Liverpool Telescopes from 2013 to 2016. This revised parallax yields an updated luminosity of , which is very close to the previous estimate but almost two times more precise. We next present an updated estimate for TRAPPIST-1 stellar mass, based on two approaches: mass from stellar evolution modeling, and empirical mass derived from dynamical masses of equivalently classified ultracool dwarfs in astrometric binaries. We combine them using a Monte-Carlo approach to derive a semi-empirical estimate for the mass of TRAPPIST-1. We also derive estimate for the radius by combining this mass with stellar density inferred from transits, as well as an estimate for the effective temperature from our revised luminosity and radius. Our final results are , , and 2516 ± 41 K. Considering the degree to which the TRAPPIST-1 system will be scrutinized in coming years, these revised and more precise stellar parameters should be considered when assessing the properties of TRAPPIST-1 planets.},

The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact.

This variation is such that when the procedure is applied to a quadratic form, it causes conjugate directions to be chosen, so the ultimate rate of convergence is fast when the method is used to minimize a general function. A further variation completes the method, and its ensures that the convergence rate from a bad approximation to a minimum is always efficient. Practical applications of the procedure have proved to be very satisfactory, and numerical examples are given in which functions of up to twenty variables are minimized.},

These photometric estimates have similar error properties as those determined from SDSS spectra. We apply this method to SDSS photometric data for over 2 million F/G stars and measure the unbiased metallicity distribution for a complete volume-limited sample of stars at distances between 500 pc and 8 kpc. The metallicity distribution can be exquisitely modeled using two components with a spatially varying number ratio, which correspond to disk and halo. The two components also possess the kinematics expected for disk and halo stars. The metallicity of the halo component is spatially invariant, while the median disk metallicity smoothly decreases with distance from the Galactic plane from À0.6 at 500 pc to À0.8 beyond several kiloparsecs. The absence of a correlation between metallicity and kinematics for disk stars is in a conﬂict with the traditional decomposition in terms of thin and thick disks. We detect coherent substructures in the kinematics-metallicity space, such as the Monoceros stream, which rotates faster than the LSR, and has a median metallicity of ½Fe/H ¼ À0:95, with an rms scatter of only \$0.15 dex. We extrapolate our results to the performance expected from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST ) and estimate that LSST will obtain metallicity measurements accurate to 0.2 dex or better, with proper-motion measurements accurate to \$0.5 mas yrÀ1, for about 200 million F/G dwarf stars within a distance limit of \$100 kpc (g {\textless} 23:5).},

	abstract = {We model the long-term X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) luminosity of TRAPPIST-1 to constrain the evolving high-energy radiation environment experienced by its planetary system. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we derive probabilistic constraints for TRAPPIST-1's stellar and XUV evolution that account for observational uncertainties, degeneracies between model parameters, and empirical data of low-mass stars. We constrain TRAPPIST-1's mass to m ⋆ = 0.089 ± 0.001 M ⊙ and find that its early XUV luminosity likely saturated at . From the posterior distribution, we infer that there is a ∼40\% chance that TRAPPIST-1 is still in the saturated phase today, suggesting that TRAPPIST-1 has maintained high activity and L XUV/L bol ≈ 10−3 for several gigayears. TRAPPIST-1's planetary system therefore likely experienced a persistent and extreme XUV flux environment, potentially driving significant atmospheric erosion and volatile loss. The inner planets likely received XUV fluxes ∼103–104 times that of the modern Earth during TRAPPIST-1's ∼1 Gyr long pre-main-sequence phase. Deriving these constraints via MCMC is computationally nontrivial, so scaling our methods to constrain the XUV evolution of a larger number of M dwarfs that harbor terrestrial exoplanets would incur significant computational expenses. We demonstrate that approxposterior, an open source Python machine learning package for approximate Bayesian inference using Gaussian processes, accurately and efficiently replicates our analysis using 980 times less computational time and 1330 times fewer simulations than MCMC sampling using emcee. We find that approxposterior derives constraints with mean errors on the best-fit values and 1σ uncertainties of 0.61\% and 5.5\%, respectively, relative to emcee.},

We add to these ground-based, HST and K2 transit time measurements, and revisit an N-body dynamical analysis of the seven-planet system using our complete set of times from which we refine the mass ratios of the planets to the star. We next carry out a photodynamical analysis of the Spitzer light curves to derive the density of the host star and the planet densities. We find that all seven planets' densities may be described with a single rocky mass-radius relation which is depleted in iron relative to Earth, with Fe 21 wt\% versus 32 wt\% for Earth, and otherwise Earth-like in composition. Alternatively, the planets may have an Earth-like composition, but enhanced in light elements, such as a surface water layer or a core-free structure with oxidized iron in the mantle. We measure planet masses to a precision of 3-5\%, equivalent to a radial-velocity (RV) precision of 2.5 cm/sec, or two orders of magnitude more precise than current RV capabilities. We find the eccentricities of the planets are very small; the orbits are extremely coplanar; and the system is stable on 10 Myr timescales. We find evidence of infrequent timing outliers which we cannot explain with an eighth planet; we instead account for the outliers using a robust likelihood function. We forecast JWST timing observations, and speculate on possible implications of the planet densities for the formation, migration and evolution of the planet system.},

	abstract = {Exoplanets residing close to their stars can experience evolution of both their physical structures and their orbits due to the influence of their host stars. In this work, we present a coupled analysis of dynamical tidal dissipation and atmospheric mass loss for exoplanets in X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) irradiated environments. As our primary application, we use this model to study the TRAPPIST-1 system and place constraints on the interior structure and orbital evolution of the planets. We start by reporting on an ultraviolet continuum flux measurement (centered around ∼1900 Å) for the star TRAPPIST-1, based on 300 ks of Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory data, and which enables an estimate of the XUV-driven thermal escape arising from XUV photodissociation for each planet. We find that the X-ray flaring luminosity, measured from our X-ray detections, of TRAPPIST-1 is 5.6 × 10−4 L *, while the full flux including non-flaring periods is 6.1 × 10−5 L *, when L * is TRAPPIST-1's bolometric luminosity. We then construct a model that includes both atmospheric mass loss and tidal evolution and requires the planets to attain their present-day orbital elements during this coupled evolution. We use this model to constrain the ratio for each planet. Finally, we use additional numerical models implemented with the Virtual Planet Simulator VPLanet to study ocean retention for these planets using our derived system parameters.},

	abstract = {With more than 1000 hours of observation from Feb 2016 to Oct 2019, the Spitzer Exploration Program Red Worlds (ID: 13067, 13175 and 14223) exclusively targeted TRAPPIST-1, a nearby (12pc) ultracool dwarf star orbited by seven transiting Earth-sized planets, all well-suited for a detailed atmospheric characterization with the upcoming JWST. In this paper, we present the global results of the project. We analyzed 88 new transits and combined them with 100 previously analyzed transits, for a total of 188 transits observed at 3.6 or 4.5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m. We also analyzed 29 occultations (secondary eclipses) of planet b and eight occultations of planet c observed at 4.5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m to constrain the brightness temperatures of their daysides. We identify several orphan transit-like structures in our Spitzer photometry, but all of them are of low significance. We do not confirm any new transiting planets. We estimate for TRAPPIST-1 transit depth measurements mean noise floors of \${\textbackslash}sim\$35 and 25 ppm in channels 1 and 2 of Spitzer/IRAC, respectively. most of this noise floor is of instrumental origins and due to the large inter-pixel inhomogeneity of IRAC InSb arrays, and that the much better interpixel homogeneity of JWST instruments should result in noise floors as low as 10ppm, which is low enough to enable the atmospheric characterization of the planets by transit transmission spectroscopy. We construct updated broadband transmission spectra for all seven planets which show consistent transit depths between the two Spitzer channels. We identify and model five distinct high energy flares in the whole dataset, and discuss our results in the context of habitability. Finally, we fail to detect occultation signals of planets b and c at 4.5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m, and can only set 3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ upper limits on their dayside brightness temperatures (611K for b 586K for c).},

	abstract = {Computer simulations are invaluable tools for scientific discovery. However, accurate simulations are often slow to execute, which limits their applicability to extensive parameter exploration, large-scale data analysis, and uncertainty quantification. A promising route to accelerate simulations by building fast emulators with machine learning requires large training datasets, which can be prohibitively expensive to obtain with slow simulations. Here we present a method based on neural architecture search to build accurate emulators even with a limited number of training data. The method successfully accelerates simulations by up to 2 billion times in 10 scientific cases including astrophysics, climate science, biogeochemistry, high energy density physics, fusion energy, and seismology, using the same super-architecture, algorithm, and hyperparameters. Our approach also inherently provides emulator uncertainty estimation, adding further confidence in their use. We anticipate this work will accelerate research involving expensive simulations, allow more extensive parameters exploration, and enable new, previously unfeasible computational discovery.},

We provide an overview of Nested Sampling, its extension to Dynamic Nested Sampling, the algorithmic challenges involved, and the various approaches taken to solve them. We then examine dynesty's performance on a variety of toy problems along with several astronomical applications. We find in particular problems dynesty can provide substantial improvements in sampling efficiency compared to popular MCMC approaches in the astronomical literature.

We also show that the accuracy of both parameter estimation and evidence calculations can be improved simultaneously. In addition, unlike in standard nested sampling, more accurate results can be obtained by continuing the calculation for longer. Popular standard nested sampling implementations can be easily adapted to perform dynamic nested sampling, and several dynamic nested sampling software packages are now publicly available.},

science goals are to study the solar magnetic dynamo and to determine
the radiative and magnetic properties of the Sun during its evolution
across the main sequence. The present paper focuses on the latter goal,
which has the ultimate purpose of providing the spectral irradiance
evolution of solar-type stars to be used in the study and modeling of
planetary atmospheres. The results from the Sun in Time program suggest
that the coronal X-ray-EUV emissions of the young main-sequence Sun were
{\textasciitilde}100-1000 times stronger than those of the present Sun. Similarly, the
transition region and chromospheric FUV-UV emissions of the young Sun
are expected to be 20-60 and 10-20 times stronger, respectively, than at
present. When we consider the integrated high-energy emission from 1 to
1200 Å, the resulting relationship indicates that about 2.5 Gyr
ago the solar high-energy flux was about 2.5 times the present value and
about 3.5 Gyr ago was about 6 times the present value (when life
supposedly arose on Earth). The strong radiation emissions inferred
should have had major influences on the thermal structure,
photochemistry, and photoionization of planetary atmospheres and have
played an important role in the development of primitive life in the
solar system. Some examples of the application of the Sun in Time
results on exoplanets and on early solar system planets are discussed.},

Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

We couple X-ray/extreme ultraviolet (XUV)-driven escape, thermal evolution, tidal evolution and orbital migration to explore the types of systems that may harbor such "habitable evaporated cores" (HECs). We find that HECs are most likely to form from planets with \${\textbackslash}sim 1 M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ solid cores with up to about 50\% H/He by mass, though whether or not a given mini-Neptune forms a HEC is highly dependent on the early XUV evolution of the host star. As terrestrial planet formation around M dwarfs by accumulation of local material is likely to form planets that are small and dry, evaporation of small migrating mini-Neptunes could be one of the dominant formation mechanisms for volatile-rich Earths around these stars.},

	abstract = {Characterizing the atmospheres of planets orbiting M dwarfs requires understanding the spectral energy distributions of M dwarfs over planetary lifetimes. Surveys like MUSCLES, HAZMAT, and FUMES have collected multiwavelength spectra across the spectral type's range of Teff and activity, but the extreme ultraviolet flux (EUV, 100 to 912 Angstroms) of most of these stars remains unobserved because of obscuration by the interstellar medium compounded with limited detector sensitivity. While targets with observable EUV flux exist, there is no currently operational facility observing between 150 and 912 Angstroms. Inferring the spectra of exoplanet hosts in this regime is critical to studying the evolution of planetary atmospheres because the EUV heats the top of the thermosphere and drives atmospheric escape. This paper presents our implementation of the differential emission measure technique to reconstruct the EUV spectra of cool dwarfs. We characterize our method's accuracy and precision by applying it to the Sun and AU Mic. We then apply it to three fainter M dwarfs: GJ 832, Barnard's Star, and TRAPPIST-1. We demonstrate that with the strongest far ultraviolet (FUV, 912 to 1700 Angstroms) emission lines, observed with Hubble Space Telescope and/or Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, and a coarse X-ray spectrum from either Chandra X-ray Observatory or XMM-Newton, we can reconstruct the Sun's EUV spectrum to within a factor of 1.8, with our model's formal uncertainties encompassing the data. We report the integrated EUV flux of our M dwarf sample with uncertainties between a factor of 2 to 7 depending on available data quality.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385},
	abstract = {In the context of science, the well-known adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" might well be "a model is worth a thousand datasets." Scientific models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simplifications of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientific basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are flexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simplified models without requiring "big data". In this work we develop a new methodology, universal differential equations (UDEs), which augments scientific models with machine-learnable structures for scientifically-based learning. We show how UDEs can be utilized to discover previously unknown governing equations, accurately extrapolate beyond the original data, and accelerate model simulation, all in a time and data-efficient manner. This advance is coupled with open-source software that allows for training UDEs which incorporate physical constraints, delayed interactions, implicitly-defined events, and intrinsic stochasticity in the model. Our examples show how a diverse set of computationally-difficult modeling issues across scientific disciplines, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to accelerating the training of physics-informed neural networks and large-eddy simulations, can all be transformed into UDE training problems that are efficiently solved by a single software methodology.},

	abstract = {M-dwarf stars are prime targets for exoplanet searches because of their close proximity and favorable properties for both planet detection and characterization. However, the potential habitability and atmospheric characterization of these exoplanetary systems depends critically on the history of high-energy stellar radiation from X-rays to NUV, which drive atmospheric mass loss and photochemistry in the planetary atmospheres. With the Far Ultraviolet M-dwarf Evolution Survey (FUMES) we have assessed the evolution of the FUV radiation, specifically 8 prominent emission lines, including Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, of M-dwarf stars with stellar rotation period and age. We demonstrate tight power-law correlations between the spectroscopic FUV features, and measure the intrinsic scatter of the quiescent FUV emissions. The luminosity evolution with rotation of these spectroscopic features is well described by a broken power-law, saturated for fast rotators, and decaying with increasing Rossby number, with a typical power-law slope of \$-2\$, although likely shallower for Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$. Our regression fits enable FUV emission line luminosity estimates relative to bolometric from known rotation periods to within \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.3 dex, across 8 distinct UV emission lines, with possible trends in the fit parameters as a function of source layer in the stellar atmosphere. Our detailed analysis of the UV luminosity evolution with age further shows that habitable zone planets orbiting lower-mass stars experience much greater high-energy radiative exposure relative the same planets orbiting more massive hosts. Around early-to-mid M-dwarfs these exoplanets, at field ages, accumulate up to 10-20\${\textbackslash}times\$ more EUV energy relative to modern Earth. Moreover, the bulk of this UV exposure likely takes place within the first Gyr of the stellar lifetime.},

	abstract = {The assembly process of our Galaxy can be retrieved using the motions and chemistry of individual stars. Chemo-dynamical studies of the nearby halo have long hinted at the presence of multiple components such as streams, clumps, duality and correlations between the stars' chemical abundances and orbital parameters. More recently, the analysis of two large stellar surveys have revealed the presence of a well-populated chemical elemental abundance sequence, of two distinct sequences in the colour-magnitude diagram, and of a prominent slightly retrograde kinematic structure all in the nearby halo, which may trace an important accretion event experienced by the Galaxy. Here report an analysis of the kinematics, chemistry, age and spatial distribution of stars in a relatively large volume around the Sun that are mainly linked to two major Galactic components, the thick disk and the stellar halo. We demonstrate that the inner halo is dominated by debris from an object which at infall was slightly more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud, and which we refer to as Gaia-Enceladus. The stars originating in Gaia-Enceladus cover nearly the full sky, their motions reveal the presence of streams and slightly retrograde and elongated trajectories. Hundreds of RR Lyrae stars and thirteen globular clusters following a consistent age-metallicity relation can be associated to Gaia-Enceladus on the basis of their orbits. With an estimated 4:1 mass-ratio, the merger with Gaia-Enceladus must have led to the dynamical heating of the precursor of the Galactic thick disk and therefore contributed to the formation of this component approximately 10 Gyr ago. These findings are in line with simulations of galaxy formation, which predict that the inner stellar halo should be dominated by debris from just a few massive progenitors.},

We demonstrate that the halo's velocity ellipsoid evolves strongly with metallicity. At the low [Fe/H] end, the orbital anisotropy (the amount of motion in the radial direction compared to the tangential one) is mildly radial with 0.2{\textless}beta{\textless}0.4. However, for stars with [Fe/H]{\textgreater}-1.7 we measure extreme values of beta{\textasciitilde}0.9. Across the metallicity range considered, i.e. -3{\textless}[Fe/H]{\textless}-1, the stellar halo's spin is minimal, at the level of 20{\textless}v\_theta (km/s) {\textless}30. Using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of halo formation, we deduce that the observed acute anisotropy is inconsistent with the continuous accretion of dwarf satellites. Instead, we argue, the stellar debris in the inner halo were deposited in a major accretion event by a satellite with Mvir{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun around the epoch of the Galactic disc formation, i.e. between 8 and 11 Gyr ago. The radical halo anisotropy is the result of the dramatic radialisation of the massive progenitor's orbit, amplified by the action of the growing disc.},

	abstract = {The advent of Gaia's 2nd data release in combination with large spectroscopic surveys are revolutionizing our understanding of the Galaxy. Thanks to these and the knowledge accumulated thus far, a more mature picture of the evolution of the early Milky Way is emerging: * Two of the traditional Galactic components, i.e. the stellar halo and the thick disk, appear to be intimately linked: stars with halo-like kinematics originate in similar proportions, from a "heated" (thick) disk and from debris from a system named Gaia-Enceladus. Gaia-Enceladus was the last big merger event experienced by the Milky Way and probably completed around 10 Gyr ago. The puffed-up stars now present in the halo as a consequence of the merger have thus exposed the existence of a disk component at z {\textasciitilde} 1.8. * The Helmi streams, Sequoia, and Thamnos are amongst the newly uncovered or better characterized merger events. Knowledge of their progenitor's properties, star formation and chemical histories is still incomplete. * Debris' from different objects often overlap in phase-space. A task for the next years will be to use spectroscopic surveys for chemical labelling and to disentangle events from one another using dimensions other than only phase-space, metallicity or [alpha/Fe]. * These surveys will also provide line-of-sight velocities missing for faint stars and more accurate distance determinations for distant objects. The resulting samples of stars will cover a much wider volume of the Galaxy allowing, for example, linking kinematic substructures in the inner halo to spatial overdensities in the outer halo. * All the results obtained so far are in-line with expectations of current cosmological models. Yet, tailored hydrodynamical simulations as well as "constrained" cosmological simulations are needed to push our knowledge of the assembly of the Milky Way back to the earliest times. [abridged]},

	abstract = {The current progress in the detection of terrestrial type exoplanets has opened a new avenue in the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres and in the search for biosignatures of life with the upcoming ground-based and space missions. To specify the conditions favorable for the origin, development and sustainment of life as we know it in other worlds, we need to understand the nature of astrospheric, atmospheric and surface environments of exoplanets in habitable zones around G-K-M dwarfs including our young Sun. Global environment is formed by propagated disturbances from the planet-hosting stars in the form of stellar flares, coronal mass ejections, energetic particles, and winds collectively known as astrospheric space weather. Its characterization will help in understanding how an exoplanetary ecosystem interacts with its host star, as well as in the specification of the physical, chemical and biochemical conditions that can create favorable and/or detrimental conditions for planetary climate and habitability along with evolution of planetary internal dynamics over geological timescales. A key linkage of (astro) physical, chemical, and geological processes can only be understood in the framework of interdisciplinary studies with the incorporation of progress in heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary and Earth sciences. The assessment of the impacts of host stars on the climate and habitability of terrestrial (exo)planets will significantly expand the current definition of the habitable zone to the biogenic zone and provide new observational strategies for searching for signatures of life. The major goal of this paper is to describe and discuss the current status and recent progress in this interdisciplinary field and to provide a new roadmap for the future development of the emerging field of exoplanetary science and astrobiology.},

	abstract = {We present a sample of 824 solar and late-type stars with X-ray luminosities and rotation periods. This is used to study the relationship between rotation and stellar activity and derive a new estimate of the convective turnover time. From an unbiased subset of this sample the power-law slope of the unsaturated regime, LX/Lbol∝Roβ, is fit as β = −2.70 ± 0.13. This is inconsistent with the canonical β = −2 slope to a confidence of 5σ, and argues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. From a simple scaling analysis this implies ΔΩ/Ω∝Ω0.7, i.e., the differential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down. Supersaturation is observed for the fastest rotators in our sample and its parametric dependencies are explored. Significant correlations are found with both the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theory providing a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. We estimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation and supersaturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. Late F-type stars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straight from supersaturated to unsaturated X-ray emission. The theoretical threshold for coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empirical saturation threshold (Ro {\textless} 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. Instead we suggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars with saturated coronal emission. This is supported by a correlation between the empirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition between convective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.},

	abstract = {In this brief communication we provide the rationale forand the outcome of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) resolution vote at the XXIXth General Assembly in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2015, on recommended nominal conversion constants for selected solar and planetary properties. The problem addressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants between solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused a proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar luminosity, solar effective temperature, and solar mass parameter) in the literature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the time of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of consistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in 2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary, and fundamental astronomy, as well as from general standardsﬁelds to converge on optimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU 2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The resolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are by deﬁnition exact and are expressed in SI units. These nominal values should be understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary properties or current best estimates. Authors and journal editors are urged to join in using the standard values set forth by this resolution in future work and publications to help minimize further confusion.},

	abstract = {We outline a mechanism that explains the observed lack of circumbinary planets (CBPs) via coupled stellar–tidal evolution of isolated binary stars. Tidal forces between low-mass, short-period binary stars on the pre-main sequence slow the stellar rotations transferring rotational angular momentum to the orbit as the stars approach the tidally locked state. This transfer increases the binary orbital period, expanding the region of dynamical instability around the binary, and destabilizing CBPs that tend to preferentially orbit just beyond the initial dynamical stability limit. After the stars tidally lock, we ﬁnd that angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking can signiﬁcantly shrink the binary orbit, and hence the region of dynamical stability, over time, impacting where surviving CBPs are observed relative to the boundary. We perform simulations over a wide range of parameter space and ﬁnd that the expansion of the instability region occurs for most plausible initial conditions and that, in some cases, the stability semimajor axis doubles from its initial value. We examine the dynamical and observable consequences of a CBP falling within the dynamical instability limit by running N-body simulations of circumbinary planetary systems and ﬁnd that, typically, at least one planet is ejected from the system. We apply our theory to the shortest-period Kepler binary that possesses a CBP, Kepler-47, and ﬁnd that its existence is consistent with our model. Under conservative assumptions, we ﬁnd that coupled stellar–tidal evolution of pre-main sequence binary stars removes at least one close-in CBP in 87\% of multi-planet circumbinary systems.},

	abstract = {We present the first application of a variance-based sensitivity analysis (SA) to a model that aims to predict the evolution and properties of the whole galaxy population. SA is a well-established technique in other quantitative sciences, but is a relatively novel tool for the evaluation of astrophysical models. We perform a multi-parameter exploration of the GALFORM semi-analytic galaxy formation model, to compute how sensitive the present-day K-band luminosity function is to varying different model parameters. The parameter space is scanned using a low-discrepancy sampling technique proposed by Saltelli. We first demonstrate the usefulness of the SA approach by varying just two model parameters, one which controls supernova feedback and the other the heating of gas by AGN. The SA analysis matches our physical intuition regarding how these parameters affect the predictions for different parts of the galaxy luminosity function. We then use SA to compute Sobol' sensitivity indices varying seven model parameters, connecting the variance in the model output to the variance in the input parameters. The sensitivity is computed in luminosity bins, allowing us to probe the origin of the model predictions in detail. We discover that the SA correctly identifies the least- and most important parameters. Moreover, the SA also captures the combined responses of varying multiple parameters at the same time. Our study marks a much needed step away from the traditional "one-at-a-time" parameter variation often used in this area and improves the transparency of multi-parameter models of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {TRAPPIST-1 is an ultracool dwarf star transited by seven Earth-sized planets, for which thorough characterization of atmospheric properties, surface conditions encompassing habitability, and internal compositions is possible with current and next-generation telescopes. Accurate modeling of the star is essential to achieve this goal. We aim to obtain updated stellar parameters for TRAPPIST-1 based on new measurements and evolutionary models, compared to those used in discovery studies. We present a new measurement for the parallax of TRAPPIST-1, 82.4 ± 0.8 mas, based on 188 epochs of observations with the TRAPPIST and Liverpool Telescopes from 2013 to 2016. This revised parallax yields an updated luminosity of , which is very close to the previous estimate but almost two times more precise. We next present an updated estimate for TRAPPIST-1 stellar mass, based on two approaches: mass from stellar evolution modeling, and empirical mass derived from dynamical masses of equivalently classified ultracool dwarfs in astrometric binaries. We combine them using a Monte-Carlo approach to derive a semi-empirical estimate for the mass of TRAPPIST-1. We also derive estimate for the radius by combining this mass with stellar density inferred from transits, as well as an estimate for the effective temperature from our revised luminosity and radius. Our final results are , , and 2516 ± 41 K. Considering the degree to which the TRAPPIST-1 system will be scrutinized in coming years, these revised and more precise stellar parameters should be considered when assessing the properties of TRAPPIST-1 planets.},

However the success of this method may require a very large number of evaluations of the (un-normalized) posterior and its partial derivatives. In situations where the posterior is computationally costly to evaluate, this may lead to an unacceptable computational load for HMC. I propose to use a Gaussian Process model of the (log of the) posterior for most of the computations required by HMC. Within this scheme only occasional evaluation of the actual posterior is required to guarantee that the samples generated have exactly the desired distribution, even if the GP model is somewhat inaccurate. The method is demonstrated on a 10 dimensional problem, where 200 evaluations sufﬁce for the generation of 100 roughly independent points from the posterior. Thus, the proposed scheme allows Bayesian treatment of models with posteriors that are computationally demanding, such as models involving computer simulation.},

The inner planet has a density consistent with an Earth-like composition, while the outer planet is extremely low-density, such that it must contain a voluminous H/He envelope. Such a density difference would pose a problem for any formation mechanism if their current densities were representative of their composition at formation. However, both planets are at close enough separations to have undergone significant evaporation in the past. We constrain the core-mass, core composition, initial envelope-mass, and initial cooling-time of each planet using evaporation models conditioned on their present-day masses and radii, as inferred from Kepler photometry and transit timing analysis. The inner planet is consistent with being an evaporatively stripped core, while the outer planet has retained some of its initial envelope due to its higher core-mass. Therefore, both planets could have had a similar formation pathway, with the inner planet having an initial envelope-mass fraction of \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textbackslash}\%\$ and core-mass of \${\textbackslash}sim4.4\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, while the outer had an initial envelope-mass fraction of order 15-30{\textbackslash}\% and core-mass \${\textbackslash}sim7.3\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. Finally, our results indicate that the outer planet had a long (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim30\$ Myr) initial cooling-time, much longer than would naively be predicted from simple timescale arguments. The long initial cooling-time could be evidence for a dramatic early cooling episode such as the recently proposed "boil-off" process.},

Fortunately, adopting a statistical approach helps us to address this question without them. In particular, we apply hierarchical Bayesian modeling to a subsample of Kepler PCs that is complete for P {\textless} 25 days and Rpl {\textgreater} 1.2 R⊕ and draw upon interior structure models that yield radii largely independent of mass by accounting for the thermal evolution of a gaseous envelope around a rocky core. Assuming the envelope is dominated by hydrogen and helium, we present the current-day composition distribution of the sub-Neptune-sized planet population and ﬁnd that H+He envelopes are most likely to be ∼1\% of these planets’ total masses with an intrinsic scatter of ±0.5 dex. We address the gaseous/rocky transition and illustrate how our results do not result in a one-to-one relationship between mass and radius for this sub-Neptune population; accordingly, dynamical studies that wish to use Kepler data must adopt a probabilistic approach to accurately represent the range of possible masses at a given radius.},

	abstract = {Although tidal dissipation in binary stars has been studied for over a century, theoretical predictions have yet to match the observed properties of binary populations. This work quantitatively examines the recent proposal of tidal circularization by resonance locking, where tidal dissipation arises from resonances between the star's natural oscillation frequencies and harmonics of the orbital frequency, and where resonances are `locked' for an extended period of time due to concurrent stellar evolution. We focus on tidal resonances with axi-symmetric gravity-modes, and examine binaries with primary masses from one to two solar masses. We find that orbital evolution via resonance locking occurs primarily during the star's pre-main-sequence phase, with the main-sequence phase contributing negligibly. Resonance locking, ignoring non-linearity, can circularize binaries with peri-centre distances out to \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ stellar radii, corresponding to circular periods of \${\textbackslash}sim 4-6\$ days. However, we find resonantly excited gravity-modes will become nonlinear in stellar cores, which prevents them from reaching their full, linear amplitudes. We estimate that such a `saturated resonance lock' reduces the circularization period by about a third, but resonance locking remains much more effective than the cumulative actions of equilibrium tides. In a companion paper, we examine recent binary data to compare against theory.},

	abstract = {Large scale dynamical systems (e.g. many nonlinear coupled differential equations) can often be summarized in terms of only a few state variables (a few equations), a trait that reduces complexity and facilitates exploration of behavioral aspects of otherwise intractable models. High model dimensionality and complexity makes symbolic, pen--and--paper model reduction tedious and impractical, a difficulty addressed by recently developed frameworks that computerize reduction. Symbolic work has the benefit, however, of identifying both reduced state variables and parameter combinations that matter most (effective parameters, "inputs"); whereas current computational reduction schemes leave the parameter reduction aspect mostly unaddressed. As the interest in mapping out and optimizing complex input--output relations keeps growing, it becomes clear that combating the curse of dimensionality also requires efficient schemes for input space exploration and reduction. Here, we explore systematic, data-driven parameter reduction by means of effective parameter identification, starting from current nonlinear manifold-learning techniques enabling state space reduction. Our approach aspires to extend the data-driven determination of effective state variables with the data-driven discovery of effective model parameters, and thus to accelerate the exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces associated with complex models.},

	abstract = {We present light curve analyses of two newly identified detached eclipsing binaries, HD 96609 and HD 303734, in the region of the richly populated open cluster NGC 3532. HD 96609 is composed of two main sequence stars (B9-A0V + A2V) with masses and radii of \$M\_\{1\}=2.66{\textbackslash}pm0.02\$\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, \$M\_\{2\}=1.84{\textbackslash}pm0.01\$\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, \$R\_\{1\}=2.740{\textbackslash}pm0.006\$\$R\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, \$R\_\{2\}=1.697{\textbackslash}pm0.005\$\$R\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. The positions of the components on \$log{\textasciitilde}M-log{\textasciitilde}R\$ plane suggests log(age/yr) 8.55, corresponding \$350{\textbackslash}pm40\$ Myr of age, which agrees with the \$300{\textbackslash}pm100\$ Myr age of NGC 3532 estimated in previous studies. We find the distance of HD 96609 as \$460{\textbackslash}pm17\$ pc, which is consistent with the \$484{\textasciicircum}\{+35\}\_\{-30\}\$ pc distance of NGC 3532, estimated from GAIA parallaxes. HD 303734 is an interesting totally eclipsing binary with a quite shallow secondary eclipse. Using photometric properties of the system in conjunction with theoretical calibrations, we estimate that HD 303734 consists of A6V + K3V components. HD 96609 and HD 303734 are the second and third eclipsing binaries discovered in the region of NGC 3532, after the first one, GV Car.},

	abstract = {Tidal evolution of eccentric binary systems containing at least one massive main-sequence (MS) star plays an important role in the formation scenarios of merging compact-object binaries. The dominant dissipation mechanism in such systems involves tidal excitation of outgoing internal gravity waves at the convective-radiative boundary and dissipation of the waves at the stellar envelope/surface. We have derived analytical expressions for the tidal torque and tidal energy transfer rate in such binaries for arbitrary orbital eccentricities and stellar rotation rates. These expressions can be used to study the spin and orbital evolution of eccentric binaries containing massive MS stars, such as the progenitors of merging neutron star binaries. Applying our results to the PSR J0045-7319 system, which has a massive B-star companion and an observed, rapidly decaying orbit, we find that for the standard radius of convective core based on non-rotating stellar models, the B-star must have a significant retrograde and differential rotation in order to explain the observed orbital decay rate. Alternatively, we suggest that the convective core may be larger as a result of rapid stellar rotation and/or mass transfer to the B-star in the recent past during the post-MS evolution of the pulsar progenitor.},

	title = {Analyzing {Inverse} {Problems} with {Invertible} {Neural} {Networks}},
	abstract = {For many applications, in particular in natural science, the task is to determine hidden system parameters from a set of measurements. Often, the forward process from parameter- to measurement-space is well-deﬁned, whereas the inverse problem is ambiguous: multiple parameter sets can result in the same measurement. To fully characterize this ambiguity, the full posterior parameter distribution, conditioned on an observed measurement, has to be determined. We argue that a particular class of neural networks is well suited for this task – so-called Invertible Neural Networks (INNs). Unlike classical neural networks, which attempt to solve the ambiguous inverse problem directly, INNs focus on learning the forward process, using additional latent output variables to capture the information otherwise lost. Due to invertibility, a model of the corresponding inverse process is learned implicitly. Given a speciﬁc measurement and the distribution of the latent variables, the inverse pass of the INN provides the full posterior over parameter space. We prove theoretically and verify experimentally, on artiﬁcial data and real-world problems from medicine and astrophysics, that INNs are a powerful analysis tool to ﬁnd multi-modalities in parameter space, uncover parameter correlations, and identify unrecoverable parameters.},

	abstract = {We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high-dimensional densities called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the Jacobian determinant and inverse transform is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting.},

	abstract = {During a solar ﬂare, it is believed that reconnection takes place in the corona followed by fast energy transport to the chromosphere. The resulting intense heating strongly disturbs the chromospheric structure and induces complex radiation hydrodynamic effects. Interpreting the physics of the ﬂaring solar atmosphere is one of the most challenging tasks in solar physics. Here we present a novel deep-learning approach, an invertible neural network, to understanding the chromospheric physics of a ﬂaring solar atmosphere via the inversion of observed solar line proﬁles in Hα and Ca II λ8542. Our network is trained using ﬂare simulations from the 1D radiation hydrodynamic code RADYN as the expected atmosphere and line proﬁle. This model is then applied to single pixels from an observation of an M1.1 solar ﬂare taken with the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope/CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter instrument just after the ﬂare onset. The inverted atmospheres obtained from observations provide physical information on the electron number density, temperature, and bulk velocity ﬂow of the plasma throughout the solar atmosphere ranging from 0 to 10 Mm in height. The density and temperature proﬁles appear consistent with the expected atmospheric response, and the bulk plasma velocity provides the gradients needed to produce the broad spectral lines while also predicting the expected chromospheric evaporation from ﬂare heating. We conclude that we have taught our novel algorithm the physics of a solar ﬂare according to RADYN and that this can be conﬁdently used for the analysis of ﬂare data taken in these two wavelengths. This algorithm can also be adapted for a menagerie of inverse problems providing extremely fast (∼10 μs) inversion samples.},

While the gap was tentatively detected in {\textbackslash}cite\{Reinhold2020\}, this work represents the first robust detection of the gap in K2 data for field stars. This is significant because K2 observed along many lines of sight at wide angular separation, in contrast to Kepler's single line of sight. Together with recent results for rotation in open clusters, we interpret this gap as evidence for a departure from the \$t{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\}\$ Skumanich spin down law, rather than an indication of a bimodal star formation history. We provide maximum likelihood estimates and uncertainties for all parameters of the quasi-periodic light curve model for each of the 284,834 stars in our sample.},

Considering that the planet rotation evolves under simultaneous actions of the torque due to the equatorial deformation and the tidal torque, both raised by the central star, we analyze the possibility of temporary captures in spin-orbit resonances. The results of the numerical simulations of the exact equations of motions indicate that, whenever the planet rotation is trapped in a resonant motion, the orbital decay and the eccentricity damping are faster than the ones in which the rotation follows the so-called pseudo-synchronization. Analytical results obtained through the averaged equations of the spin-orbit problem show a good agreement with the numerical simulations. We apply the analysis to the cases of the recently discovered hot super-Earths Kepler-10 b, GJ 3634 b and 55 Cnc e. The simulated dynamical history of these systems indicates the possibility of capture in several spin-orbit resonances; particularly, GJ 3634 b and 55 Cnc e can currently evolve under a non-synchronous resonant motion for suitable values of the parameters. Moreover, 55 Cnc e may avoid a chaotic rotation behavior by evolving towards synchronization through successive temporary resonant trappings.},

We demonstrate both analytically and numerically that except if the system was formed with a nearly circular orbit (e {\textless}∼ 0.2), consistently solving the complete tidal equations is mandatory to derive correct tidal evolution histories. We show that calculations based on tidal models truncated at 2nd order in eccentricity, as done in all previous studies, lead to quantitatively and sometimes even qualitatively erroneous tidal evolutions. As a consequence, tidal energy dissipation rates are severely underestimated in all these calculations and the characteristic timescales for the various orbital parameters evolutions can be wrong by up to three orders of magnitude.

	abstract = {Stellar insolation has been used as the main constraint on a planet's habitability. However, as more Earth-like planets are discovered around low-mass stars (LMSs), a re-examination of the role of tides on the habitability of exoplanets has begun. Those studies have yet to consider the misalignment between a planet's rotational axis and the orbital plane normal, i.e. the planetary obliquity. We apply two equilibrium tide theories to compute the obliquity evolution of terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones around LMSs. The time for the obliquity to decrease from an Earth-like obliquity of 23.5 deg to 5 deg, the 'tilt erosion time', is compared to the traditional insolation habitable zone (IHZ) as a function of semi-major axis, eccentricity, and stellar mass. We also compute tidal heating and equilibrium rotation caused by obliquity tides. The Super-Earth Gl581d and the planet candidate Gl581g are studied as examples for tidal processes. Earth-like obliquities of terrestrial planets in the IHZ around {\textless}0.25 solar mass (M\_sun) stars are eroded in {\textless}0.1 Gyr. Only terrestrial planets orbiting stars with masses {\textgreater}0.9 M\_sun experience tilt erosion times larger than 1 Gyr throughout the IHZ. Terrestrial planets in the IHZ of stars with masses {\textless}0.25 M\_sun undergo significant tidal heating due to obliquity tides. The predictions of the two tidal models diverge significantly for e{\textgreater}0.3. In our two-body simulations, Gl581d's obliquity is eroded to 0 and its rotation period reached its equilibrium state of half its orbital period in {\textless}0.1 Gyr. Tidal surface heating on the putative Gl581g is {\textless}150 mW/m{\textasciicircum}2 as long as its eccentricity is {\textless}0.3. Obliquity tides modify the concept of the habitable zone. Tilt erosion of terrestrial planets orbiting LMSs should be included by atmospheric modelers. Tidal heating needs to be considered by geologists.},

	abstract = {We present detailed structure and evolution calculations for the ﬁrst transiting extrasolar planets discovered by the space-based CoRoT mission. Comparisons between theoretical and observed radii provide information on the internal composition of the CoRoT objects. We distinguish three diﬀerent categories of planets emerging from these discoveries and from previous ground-based surveys: (i) planets explained by standard planetary models including irradiation; (ii) abnormally bloated planets; and (iii) massive objects belonging to the overlapping mass regime between planets and brown dwarfs. For the second category, we show that tidal heating can explain the relevant CoRoT objects, providing non-zero eccentricities. We stress that the usual assumption of a quick circularization of the orbit by tides, as usually done in transit light curve analysis, is not justiﬁed a priori, as suggested recently by Levrard et al. (2009), and that eccentricity analysis should be carefully redone for some observations. Finally, special attention is devoted to CoRoT-3b and to the identiﬁcation of its very nature: giant planet or brown dwarf? The radius determination of this object conﬁrms the theoretical mass-radius predictions for gaseous bodies in the substellar regime but, given the present observational uncertainties, does not allow an unambiguous identiﬁcation of its very nature. This opens the avenue, however, to an observational identiﬁcation of these two distinct astrophysical populations, brown dwarfs and giant planets, in their overlapping mass range, as done for the case of the 8 Jupiter-mass object Hat-P-2b. According to the presently published error bars for the radius determination and to our present theoretical description of planet structure and evolution, the high mean density of this object requires a substantial metal enrichment of the interior and is inconsistent at about the 2-sigma limit with the expected radius of a solar-metallicity brown dwarf. Within the aforementioned observational and theoretical determinations, this allows a clear identiﬁcation of its planetary nature, suggesting that planets may form up to at least 8 Jupiter masses.},

	abstract = {While it is accepted that the eccentricity of Mercury (0.206) favours entrapment into the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, open is the question how and when the capture took place. A recent work by Makarov (2012) has demonstrated that trapping into this resonance is certain if the eccentricity is larger than 0.2, provided that we use a realistic tidal model, the one which is based on the Darwin-Kaula expansion of the tidal torque. The physics-based tidal model changes dramatically the statistics of the possible final spin states. First, we discover that after only one encounter with the spin-orbit 3:2 resonance this resonance becomes the most probable end-state. Second, if a capture into this (or any other) resonance takes place, the capture becomes final, several crossings of the same state being forbidden by our model. Third, within our model the trapping of Mercury happens much faster than previously believed: for most histories, 10 - 20 Myr are sufficient. Fourth, even a weak laminar friction between the solid mantle and a molten core would most likely result in a capture in the 2:1 or even higher resonance. So the principal novelty of our paper is that the 3:2 end-state is more ancient than the same end-state obtained when the constant time lag model is employed. The swift capture justifies our treatment of Mercury as a homogeneous, unstratified body whose liquid core had not yet formed by the time of trapping. We also provide a critical analysis of the hypothesis by Wieczorek et al. (2012) that the early Mercury might had been retrograde, whereafter it synchronised its spin and then accelerated it to the 3:2 resonance. Accurate processing of the available data on cratering does not support that hypothesis, while the employment of a realistic rheology invalidates a key element of the hypothesis, an intermediate pseudosynchronous state needed to spin-up to the 3:2 resonance.},

	abstract = {We address the expressions for the rates of the Keplerian orbital elements within a two-body problem perturbed by the tides in both partners. The formulae for these rates have appeared in the literature in various forms, at times with errors. We reconsider, from scratch, the derivation of these rates and arrive at the Lagrange-type equations which, in some details, differ from the corresponding equations obtained previously by Kaula (1964). We also write down detailed expressions for \$da/dt\$, \$de/dt\$ and \$di/dt\$, to order \$e{\textasciicircum}4\$. They differ from Kaula's expressions which contain a redundant factor of \$M/(M+M{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\}),\$ with \$M\$ and \$M{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\}\$ being the masses of the primary and the secondary. As Kaula was interested in the Earth-Moon system, this redundant factor was close to unity and was unimportant in his developments. This factor, however, must be reinstated when Kaula's theory is applied to a binary composed of partners of comparable masses. We have found that, while it is legitimate to simply sum the primary's and secondary's inputs in \$da/dt\$ or \$de/dt\$, this is not the case for \$di/dt\$. So our expression for \$di/dt\$ differs from that of Kaula in two regards. First, the contribution due to the dissipation in the secondary averages out when the apsidal precession is uniform. Second, we have obtained an additional term which emerges owing to the conservation of the angular momentum: a change in the inclination of the orbit causes a change of the primary's plane of equator.},

Our approach remains regular for any spin rate and orientation, and for any orbital configuration including high eccentricities and close encounters. The method is to integrate simultaneously the rotation and the position of the planet as well as its deformation. We provide the equations of motion both in the body frame and in the inertial frame. With this study, we generalize preexisting models to the spatial case and to arbitrary multipole orders using a formalism taken from quantum theory. We also provide the vectorial expression of the secular tidal torque expanded in Fourier series. Applying this model to close-in exoplanets, we observe that if the relaxation time is longer than the revolution period, the phase space of the system is characterized by the presence of several spin-orbit resonances, even in the circular case. As the system evolves, the planet spin can visit different spin-orbit configurations. The obliquity is decreasing along most of these resonances, but we observe a case where the planet tilt is instead growing. These conclusions derived from the secular torque are successfully tested with numerical integrations of the instantaneous equations of motion on HD 80606b. Our formalism is also well adapted to close-in super-Earths in multiplanet systems which are known to have non-zero mutual inclinations.},

	abstract = {Spin-orbit coupling can be described in two approaches. The method known as "the MacDonald torque" is often combined with an assumption that the quality factor Q is frequency-independent. This makes the method inconsistent, because the MacDonald theory tacitly fixes the rheology by making Q scale as the inverse tidal frequency. Spin-orbit coupling can be treated also in an approach called "the Darwin torque". While this theory is general enough to accommodate an arbitrary frequency-dependence of Q, this advantage has not yet been exploited in the literature, where Q is assumed constant or is set to scale as inverse tidal frequency, the latter assertion making the Darwin torque equivalent to a corrected version of the MacDonald torque. However neither a constant nor an inverse-frequency Q reflect the properties of realistic mantles and crusts, because the actual frequency-dependence is more complex. Hence the necessity to enrich the theory of spin-orbit interaction with the right frequency-dependence. We accomplish this programme for the Darwin-torque-based model near resonances. We derive the frequency-dependence of the tidal torque from the first principles, i.e., from the expression for the mantle's compliance in the time domain. We also explain that the tidal torque includes not only the secular part, but also an oscillating part. We demonstrate that the lmpq term of the Darwin-Kaula expansion for the tidal torque smoothly goes through zero, when the secondary traverses the lmpq resonance (e.g., the principal tidal torque smoothly goes through nil as the secondary crosses the synchronous orbit). We also offer a possible explanation for the unexpected frequency-dependence of the tidal dissipation rate in the Moon, discovered by LLR.},

In a resonance lock, a given stellar or planetary mode is trapped in a highly resonant state for an extended period of time, during which the spin and orbital frequencies vary in concert to maintain the resonance. This phenomenon is qualitatively similar to resonance capture in planetary dynamics. We show that resonance locks can accelerate the course of tidal evolution in eccentric systems and also efficiently couple spin and orbital evolution in circular binaries. Previous analyses of resonance locking have not treated the mode amplitude as a fully dynamical variable, but rather assumed the adiabatic (i.e. Lorentzian) approximation valid only in the limit of relatively strong mode damping. We relax this approximation, analytically derive conditions under which the fixed point associated with resonance locking is stable, and further check these analytic results using numerical integrations of the coupled mode, spin, and orbital evolution equations. These show that resonance locking can sometimes take the form of complex limit cycles or even chaotic trajectories. We provide simple analytic formulae that define the binary and mode parameter regimes in which resonance locks of some kind occur (stable, limit cycle, or chaotic). We briefly discuss the astrophysical implications of our results for white dwarf and neutron star binaries as well as eccentric stellar binaries.},

	abstract = {On the main sequence, low-mass and solar-like stars are observed to spin-down over time, and magnetized stellar winds are thought to be predominantly responsible for this significant angular momentum loss. Previous studies have demonstrated that the wind torque can be predicted via formulations dependent on stellar properties, such as magnetic field strength and geometry, stellar radius and mass, wind mass-loss rate, and stellar rotation rate. Although these stars are observed to experience surface differential rotation, torque formulations so far have assumed solid-body rotation. Surface differential rotation is expected to affect the rotation of the wind and thus the angular momentum loss. To investigate how differential rotation affects the torque, we use the PLUTO code to perform 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic, axisymmetric simulations of stellar winds, using a colatitude-dependent surface differential rotation profile that is solar-like (i.e., rotation is slower at the poles than the equator). We demonstrate that the torque is determined by the average rotation rate in the wind, so that the net torque is less than that predicted by assuming solid-body rotation at the equatorial rate. The magnitude of the effect is essentially proportional to the magnitude of the surface differential rotation, for example, resulting in a torque for the Sun that is \${\textbackslash}sim 20 {\textbackslash}\%\$ smaller than predicted by the solid-body assumption. We derive and fit a semi-analytic formulation that predicts the torque as a function of the equatorial spin rate, magnitude of differential rotation, and wind magnetization (depending on the dipolar magnetic field strength and mass-loss rate, combined).},

We demonstrate that this new formulation explains why the lowest mass stars are observed to maintain rapid rotation for much longer than solar-mass stars, and simultaneously why older populations exhibit a sequence of slowly rotating stars, in which the low-mass stars rotate more slowly than solar-mass stars. The model also reproduces some previously unexplained features in the period–mass diagram for the Kepler ﬁeld, notably: the particular shape of the “upper envelope” of the distribution, suggesting that ∼95\% of Kepler ﬁeld stars with measured rotation periods are younger than ∼4 Gyr; and the shape of the “lower envelope,” corresponding to the location where stars transition between magnetically saturated and unsaturated regimes.},

	abstract = {We analyzed three years of data from the Kepler space mission to derive rotation periods of main-sequence stars below 6500 K. Our automated autocorrelation-based method detected rotation periods between 0.2 and 70 days for 34,030 (25.6\%) of the 133,030 main-sequence Kepler targets (excluding known eclipsing binaries and Kepler Objects of Interest), making this the largest sample of stellar rotation periods to date. In this paper we consider the detailed features of the now well-populated period–temperature distribution and demonstrate that the period bimodality, first seen by McQuillan et al. in the M-dwarf sample, persists to higher masses, becoming less visible above 0.6 M☉. We show that these results are globally consistent with the existing ground-based rotation-period data and find that the upper envelope of the period distribution is broadly consistent with a gyrochronological age of 4.5 Gyr, based on the isochrones of Barnes, Mamajek, \& Hillenbrand and Meibom et al. We also performed a detailed comparison of our results to those of Reinhold et al. and Nielsen et al., who measured rotation periods of field stars observed by Kepler. We examined the amplitude of periodic variability for the stars with detection rotation periods, and found a typical range between ∼950 ppm (5th percentile) and ∼22,700 ppm (95th percentile), with a median of ∼5600 ppm. We found typically higher amplitudes for shorter periods and lower effective temperatures, with an excess of low-amplitude stars above ∼5400 K.},

The rotation frequency spread in 2562 carefully selected stars with known rotation periods is measured using time–frequency diagrams. Because rotational shear is both a function of effective temperature and rotation rate, it is necessary to separate the two effects by calculating the rotation shear in restricted ranges of effective temperature and rotation period. The shear increases to a maximum in F stars, but decreases somewhat in the A stars. Theoretical models reproduce the variation of rotational shear with effective temperature quite well for all rotation rates. The dependence of the shear on the rotation rate is weak in K and G stars, increases rapidly for F stars and is strongest in A stars. For stars earlier than type K, a discrepancy exists between the predicted and observed variation of shear with rotation rate.},

	abstract = {Many Sun-like stars are observed to host close-in super-Earths (SEs) as part of a multi-planetary system. In such a system, the spin of the SE evolves due to spin-orbit resonances and tidal dissipation. In the absence of tides, the planet's obliquity can evolve chaotically to large values. However, for close-in SEs, tidal dissipation is significant and suppresses the chaos, instead driving the spin into various steady states. We find that the attracting steady states of the SE's spin are more numerous than previously thought, due to the discovery of a new class of "mixed-mode" high-obliquity equilibria. These new equilibria arise due to subharmonic responses of the parametrically-driven planetary spin, an unusual phenomenon that arises in nonlinear systems. Many SEs should therefore have significant obliquities, with potentially large impacts on the physical conditions of their surfaces and atmospheres.},

	abstract = {The rotational evolution of cool stars is governed by magnetized stellar winds that slow the stellar rotation during their main sequence lifetimes. Magnetic variability is commonly observed in Sun-like stars, and the changing strength and topology of the global ﬁeld is expected to affect the torque exerted by the stellar wind. We present three different methods for computing the angular momentum loss in the solar wind. Two are based on MHD simulations from Finley \& Matt (2018), with one using the open ﬂux measured in the solar wind, and the other using remotely observed surface magnetograms. Both methods agree in the variation of the solar torque seen through the solar cycle and show a 30\%–40\% decrease from cycles 23 to 24. The two methods calculate different average values, 2.9×1030 erg (open ﬂux) and 0.35×1030 erg (surface ﬁeld). This discrepancy results from the already well-known difﬁculty of reconciling the magnetograms with the observed open ﬂux, which is currently not understood, leading to an inability to discriminate between these two calculated torques. The third method is based on the observed spin rates of Sun-like stars, which decrease with age, directly probing the average angular momentum loss. This method gives 6.2×1030 erg for the solar torque, larger than the other methods. This may be indicative of further variability in the solar torque on timescales much longer than the magnetic cycle. We discuss the implications for applying the formula to other Sun-like stars, where only surface ﬁeld measurements are available, and where the magnetic variations are ill-constrained.},

The equations of motion admit periodic solutions associated with resonant motions, the most important being the synchronous one in which most evolved satellites of the Solar system, including the Moon, are observed. Such primary resonances can be surrounded by a chain of smaller islands which one refers to as secondary resonances. Here, we propose a novel canonical normalization procedure allowing to obtain a higher order normal form, by which we obtain analytical results on the stability of the primary resonances as well as on the bifurcation thresholds of the secondary resonances. The procedure makes use of the expansion in a parameter, called the detuning, measuring the shift from the exact secondary resonance. Also, we implement the so-called ‘book-keeping’ method, i.e. the introduction of a suitable separation of the terms in orders of smallness in the normal form construction, which deals simultaneously with all the small parameters of the problem. Our analytical computation of the bifurcation curves is in excellent agreement with the results obtained by a numerical integration of the equations of motion, thus providing relevant information on the parameter regions where satellites can be found in a stable configuration.},

	abstract = {In this study, a new expansion of planetary disturbing function is developed for describing the resonant dynamics of minor bodies with arbitrary inclinations and semimajor axis ratios. In practice, the disturbing function is expanded around circular orbits in the first step and then, in the second step, the resulting mutual interaction between circular orbits is expanded around a reference point. As usual, the resulting expansion is presented in the Fourier series form, where the force amplitudes are dependent on the semimajor axis, eccentricity and inclination and the harmonic arguments are linear combinations of the mean longitude, longitude of pericenter and longitude of ascending node of each mass. The resulting new expansion is valid for arbitrary inclinations and semimajor axis ratios. In the case of mean motion resonant configuration, the disturbing function can be easily averaged to produce the analytical expansion of resonant disturbing function. Based on the analytical expansion, the Hamiltonian model of mean motion resonances is formulated, and the resulting analytical developments are applied to Jupiter's inner and co-orbital resonances and Neptune's exterior resonances. Analytical expansion is validated by comparing the analytical results with the associated numerical outcomes.},

For close-in planets and satellites, the rotation slowly evolves due to dissipative tidal effects until some kind of equilibrium is reached. When the orbits are nearly circular, the rotation period is believed to always end synchronous with the orbital period. Here we demonstrate that for coorbital bodies in quasi-circular orbits, stable non-synchronous rotation is possible for a wide range of mass ratios and body shapes. We show the existence of an entirely new family of spin–orbit resonances at the frequencies n ± kν/2, where n is the orbital mean motion, ν the orbital libration frequency, and k an integer. In addition, when the natural rotational libration frequency due to the axial asymmetry, σ , has the same magnitude as ν, the rotation becomes chaotic. Saturn coorbital satellites are synchronous since ν σ , but coorbital exoplanets may present non-synchronous or chaotic rotation. Our results prove that the spin dynamics of a body cannot be dissociated from its orbital environment. We further anticipate that a similar mechanism may affect the rotation of bodies in any mean-motion resonance.},

	abstract = {Tidal effects arise from differential and inelastic deformation of a planet by a perturbing body. The continuous action of tides modify the rotation of the planet together with its orbit until an equilibrium situation is reached. It is often believed that synchronous motion is the most probable outcome of the tidal evolution process, since synchronous rotation is observed for the majority of the satellites in the Solar System. However, in the 19th century, Schiaparelli also assumed synchronous motion for the rotations of Mercury and Venus, and was later shown to be wrong. Rather, for planets in eccentric orbits synchronous rotation is very unlikely. The rotation period and axial tilt of exoplanets is still unknown, but a large number of planets have been detected close to the parent star and should have evolved to a final equilibrium situation. Therefore, based on the Solar System well studied cases, we can make some predictions for exoplanets. Here we describe in detail the main tidal effects that modify the secular evolution of the spin and the orbit of a planet. We then apply our knowledge acquired from Solar System situations to exoplanet cases. In particular, we will focus on two classes of planets, "Hot-Jupiters" (fluid) and "Super-Earths" (rocky with atmosphere).},

However, the initial orientation of Mercury's rotation axis is unknown and probably much different than today. As a consequence, we believe that the obliquity could have been significant when the rotation rate of the planet first encountered spin-orbit resonances. In order to compute the capture probabilities in resonance for any evolutionary scenario, we present in full detail the dynamical equations governing the long term evolution of the spin, including the obliquity contribution. The secular spin evolution of Mercury results from tidal interactions with the Sun, but also from viscous friction at the core-mantle boundary. Here, this effect is also regarded with particular attention. Previous studies show that a liquid core enhances drastically the chances of capture in spin-orbit resonances. We confirm these results for null obliquity, but we find that the capture probability generally decreases as the obliquity increases. We finally show that, when core-mantle friction is combined with obliquity evolution, the spin can evolve into some unexpected configurations as the synchronous or the 1/2 spin-orbit resonance.},

The results provide evidence that the librations are quasi-periodic in time, consisting of a slow oscillation, with an amplitude of order of arcminutes, superimposed on the 88-d libration. This contrasts with recent astronomical observations and hence suggests that the 3:2 resonance in which Mercury has been trapped might have been originally described by a large-amplitude quasi-periodic libration that, only at a later stage, with the formation of a molten core, evolved into the small-amplitude libration that is observed today.},

	abstract = {The 3:2 spin-orbit resonance between the rotational and orbital motions of Mercury (the periods are Pφ = 56.646 and Pλ = 87.969 days respectively) results from a functional dependance of the tidal friction adding to a non-zero eccentricity and a permanent asymmetry in the equatorial plane of the planet. The upcoming space missions, MESSENGER and BepiColombo with onboard instrumentation capable of measuring the rotational parameters stimulate the objective to reach an accurate theory of the rotational motion of Mercury. For obtaining the real motion of Mercury, we have used our BJV model of solar system integration including the coupled spin-orbit motion of the Moon. This model, expanded in a relativistic framework, had been previously built in accordance with the requirements of the Lunar Laser Ranging observational accuracy. We have extended the BJV model by generalizing the spin-orbit couplings to the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars). The updated model is called SONYR (acronym of Spin-Orbit N-BodY Relativistic model). As a consequence, the SONYR model gives an accurate simultaneous integration of the spin-orbit motion of Mercury. It permits one to analyze the diﬀerent families of rotational librations and identify their causes such as planetary interactions or the parameters involved in the dynamical ﬁgure of the planet. The spin-orbit motion of Mercury is characterized by two proper frequencies (namely Φ = 15.847 yrs and Ψ = 1066 yrs) and its 3:2 resonance presents a second synchronism which can be understood as a spin-orbit secular resonance (Π = 278 898 yrs). A new determination of the mean obliquity is proposed in the paper. By using the SONYR model, we ﬁnd a mean obliquity of 1.6 arcmin. This value is consistent with the Cassini state of Mercury. Besides, we identify in the Hermean librations the impact of the uncertainty of the greatest principal moment of inertia (C/MR2) on the obliquity and on the libration in longitude (2.3 milliarcsec and 0.45 arcsec respectively for an increase of 1\% on the C/MR2 value). These determinations prove to be suitable for providing constraints on the internal structure of Mercury.},

	abstract = {A plot of spin rate versus orientation when Hyperion is at the pericenter of its orbit (surface of section) reveals a large chaotic zone surrounding the synchronous spin-orbit state of Hyperion, if the satellite is assumed to be rotating about a principal axis which is normal to its orbit plane. This means that Hyperion's rotation in this zone exhibits large, essentially random variations on a short time scale. The chaotic zone is so large that it surrounds the ½ and 2 states, and libration in the 3/2 state is not possible. Stability analysis shows that for libration in the synchronous and ½ states, the orientation of the spin axis normal to the orbit plane is unstable, whereas rotation in the 2 state is attitude stable. Rotation in the chaotic zone is also attitude unstable. A small deviation of the principal axis from the orbit normal leads to motion through all angles in both the chaotic zone and the attitude unstable libration regions. Measures of the exponential rate of separation of nearby trajectories in phase space (Lyapunov characteristic exponents) for these three-dimensional motions indicate the the tumbling is chaotic and not just a regular motion through large angles. As tidal dissipation drives Hyperion's spin toward a nearly synchronous value, Hyperion necessarily enters the large chaotic zone. At this point Hyperion becomes attitude unstable and begins to tumble. Capture from the chaotic state into the synchronous or ½ state is impossible since they are also attitude unstable. The 3/2 state does not exist. Capture into the stable 2 state is possible, but improbable. It is expected that Hyperion will be found tumbling chaotically.},

	abstract = {We point out that the MacDonald formula for body-tide torques is valid only in the zeroth order of e/Q, while its time-average is valid in the first order. So the formula cannot be used for analysis in higher orders of e/Q. This necessitates corrections in the theory of tidal despinning and libration damping. We prove that when the inclination is low and phase lags are linear in frequency, the Kaula series is equivalent to a corrected version of the MacDonald method. The correction to MacDonald's approach would be to set the phase lag of the integral bulge proportional to the instantaneous frequency. The equivalence of descriptions gets violated by a nonlinear frequency-dependence of the lag. We explain that both the MacDonald- and Darwin-torque-based derivations of the popular formula for the tidal despinning rate are limited to low inclinations and to the phase lags being linear in frequency. The Darwin-torque-based derivation, though, is general enough to accommodate both a finite inclination and the actual rheology. Although rheologies with Q scaling as the frequency to a positive power make the torque diverge at a zero frequency, this reveals not the impossible nature of the rheology, but a flaw in mathematics, i.e., a common misassumption that damping merely provides lags to the terms of the Fourier series for the tidal potential. A hydrodynamical treatment (Darwin 1879) had demonstrated that the magnitudes of the terms, too, get changed. Reinstating of this detail tames the infinities and rehabilitates the "impossible" scaling law (which happens to be the actual law the terrestrial planets obey at low frequencies).},

	abstract = {The perturbing potential due to the tidal interaction between the earth, sun, and moon is obtained without restrictive assumptions on the internal constitution of the earth. The derived potential is used in Gauss's equations for the time rate of change of the eccentricity, semimajor axis, and inclination of the moon's orbit. The tidal forces perturb the elements describing the earth's motion about the sun by a negligibly small amount. The variation in the earth's angular momentum due to the solar and lunar tides is described by Euler's equations. It is assumed that the moment of inertia of the earth corresponds to that appropriate for a rotating fluid with the density distribution of the present earth. The rate of change of the moon's orbital elements is determined by the phase lag in the elastic component of the tidal bulge raised by the sun and moon. Astronomical data give a current value of the lag of the lunar tidal bulge of 2.16°. The present phase lag corresponds to a rate of increase of the semimajor axis of 3.2 cm yr−1, a rate of decrease of the inclination of the moon's orbital plane of 9.35 × 10−12 rad yr−1, and a rate of increase in the eccentricity of 1.2 × 10−10 yr−1. The obliquity of the earth's equator to the ecliptic and the period of rotation are increasing at present, owing to the combined effects of the lunar and solar tides. The effects of the solar tides are small at present but become important in the future. Numerical integrations of the coupled Gauss-Euler equations are used to describe both the past history and the future evolution of the earth-moon system. If the moon traveled a circular orbit, a backward tracing of the history shows the moon approaching the earth, reaching a minimum distance of 2.72 present earth radii. During the time of closest approach, the inclination and obliquity change rapidly, with the moon's orbital plane passing over the pole and the moon's motion becoming retrograde. If the orbit is eccentric, the eccentricity increases rapidly at the time of close approach. The perigee height remains nearly constant, while the apogee increases without bounds over a time of about 1000 years. If the current phase lag remains constant, the time of closest approach is only 1.78 × 109 years ago. Thus, the current phase lag is not consistent with the hypothesis that the earth-moon system has existed throughout geologic time. The rotational parameters of Mars, Venus, and Mercury are discussed in terms of the dynamical theory. The distribution of rotational angular momentum of the solar system is described, and it is proposed that the major planets and Mars have lost only a very small proportion of their initial rotational angular momentum. The observed dependence of rotational angular momentum on planetary mass yields an estimate of the initial rotational period of the earth of between 9 and 13 hours. The mechanisms by which the earth's rotational energy can be dissipated are reviewed. It is argued that the phase lag in the tides may have remained constant over geologic time or may have been somewhat larger. This conclusion raises the problem of the age of the earth-moon system. Theories of the origin of the moon are discussed against the requirements imposed by dynamical considerations. It is concluded that the theories of the fission of the earth to form the moon must be discarded, because the moon, once placed in the equatorial orbit, would remain there. Dynamics places severe constraints on the initial conditions for either a capture origin or the development of a binary system. The theory of several initial moons is briefly described, as are the climatological and tectonic problems raised by the consideration of the past history of the earth-moon system.},

	abstract = {Physical librations could significantly contribute to Enceladus' geophysics through their influence on tidal stress. Therefore it is important to determine their behavior and the present paper is devoted to estimating Enceladus' libration in longitude. In a rotational model of Enceladus with no global ocean, we introduce the main perturbative terms of its orbital longitude and the tidal coupling. The main librations of Enceladus are related to indirect perturbations of the orbit of Enceladus by Dione (11 years and 3.7 years periods) with amplitudes of 933.4″ (1.14 km) and 676.6″ (827 m), respectively. These amplitudes are almost independent of the body's triaxiality. The third main libration is due to the direct gravitational attraction of Saturn and its period is equal to that of the mean anomaly of Enceladus with an amplitude between 93.1″ and 113.5″ (i.e., 112 and 139 m), depending on triaxiality. These amplitudes are consistent with the upper bound of 1.5° (6.6 km) inferred from observations with the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft. The nonrigid body libration amplitudes due to tidal coupling are negligible. Nevertheless, tidal dissipation induces a small phase shift up to 0.57° corresponding to a displacement of Enceladus' figure of 1 m along the moon's equator at the mean anomaly period.},

The existence of such conﬁgurations was deduced from oversimpliﬁed tidal models assuming either a constant tidal torque or a torque linear in the tidal frequency. A more accurate treatment requires that the torque be decomposed into the Darwin–Kaula series over the tidal modes, and that this decomposition be combined with a realistic choice of rheological properties of the mantle, which we choose to be a combination of the Andrade model at ordinary frequencies and the Maxwell model at low frequencies. This development demonstrates that there exist no stable equilibrium states for solid planets and moons, other than spin–orbit resonances.},

The probability of capture in the higher 2:1 resonance is approximately 0.23. These results are conﬁrmed by a semi-analytical estimation of capture probabilities as functions of eccentricity for both prograde and retrograde evolutions of spin rate. As follows from analysis of equilibrium torques, entrapment in 3:2 resonance is inevitable at eccentricities between 0.2 and 0.41. Considering the phase space parameters at the times of periastron, the range of spin rates and phase angles for which an immediate resonance passage is triggered is very narrow, and yet a planet like Mercury rarely fails to align itself into this state of unstable equilibrium before it traverses 2:1 resonance.},

	abstract = {Tidal interactions between Saturn and its satellites play a crucial role in both the orbital migration of the satellites and the heating of their interiors. Therefore constraining the tidal dissipation of Saturn (here the ratio k2/Q) opens the door to the past evolution of the whole system. If Saturn's tidal ratio can be determined at different frequencies, it may also be possible to constrain the giant planet's interior structure, which is still uncertain. Here, we try to determine Saturn's tidal ratio through its current effect on the orbits of the main moons, using astrometric data spanning more than a century. We find an intense tidal dissipation (k2/Q= (2.3 {\textbackslash}pm 0.7) {\textbackslash}times 10-4), which is about ten times higher than the usual value estimated from theoretical arguments. As a consequence, eccentricity equilibrium for Enceladus can now account for the huge heat emitted from Enceladus' south pole. Moreover, the measured k2/Q is found to be poorly sensitive to the tidal frequency, on the short frequency interval considered. This suggests that Saturn's dissipation may not be controlled by turbulent friction in the fluid envelope as commonly believed. If correct, the large tidal expansion of the moon orbits due to this strong Saturnian dissipation would be inconsistent with the moon formations 4.5 Byr ago above the synchronous orbit in the Saturnian subnebulae. But it would be compatible with a new model of satellite formation in which the Saturnian satellites formed possibly over longer time scale at the outer edge of the main rings. In an attempt to take into account for possible significant torques exerted by the rings on Mimas, we fitted a constant rate da/dt on Mimas semi-major axis, also. We obtained an unexpected large acceleration related to a negative value of da/dt= -(15.7 {\textbackslash}pm 4.4) {\textbackslash}times 10-15 au/day.},

This means that Hyperion's rotation in this zone exhibits large, essentially random variations on a short time scale. The chaotic zone is so large that it surrounds the ½ and 2 states, and libration in the 3/2 state is not possible. Stability analysis shows that for libration in the synchronous and ½ states, the orientation of the spin axis normal to the orbit plane is unstable, whereas rotation in the 2 state is attitude stable. Rotation in the chaotic zone is also attitude unstable. A small deviation of the principal axis from the orbit normal leads to motion through all angles in both the chaotic zone and the attitude unstable libration regions. Measures of the exponential rate of separation of nearby trajectories in phase space (Lyapunov characteristic exponents) for these three-dimensional motions indicate the the tumbling is chaotic and not just a regular motion through large angles. As tidal dissipation drives Hyperion's spin toward a nearly synchronous value, Hyperion necessarily enters the large chaotic zone. At this point Hyperion becomes attitude unstable and begins to tumble. Capture from the chaotic state into the synchronous or ½ state is impossible since they are also attitude unstable. The 3/2 state does not exist. Capture into the stable 2 state is possible, but improbable. It is expected that Hyperion will be found tumbling chaotically.},

	abstract = {The definition of the binomial coefficient in terms of gamma functions also allows non-integer arguments. For nonnegative integer arguments the gamma functions reduce to factorials, leading to the well-known Pascal triangle. Using a symmetry formula for the gamma function, this definition is extended to negative integer arguments, making the symmetry identity for binomial coefficients valid for all integer arguments. The agreement of this definition with some other identities and with the binomial theorem is investigated.},

	abstract = {We develop a general framework for interpreting and analysing high-precision light curves from eccentric stellar binaries. Although our methods are general, we focus on the recently discovered Kepler system KOI-54, a face-on binary of two A stars with e= 0.83 and an orbital period of 42 days. KOI-54 exhibits strong ellipsoidal variability during its periastron passage; its light curve also contains ∼20 pulsations at perfect harmonics of the orbital frequency, and another ∼10 non-harmonic pulsations. Analysis of such data is a new form of asteroseismology in which oscillation amplitudes and phases rather than frequencies contain information that can be mined to constrain stellar properties. We qualitatively explain the physics of mode excitation and the range of harmonics expected to be observed. To quantitatively model observed pulsation spectra, we develop and apply a linear, tidally forced, non-adiabatic stellar oscillation formalism including the Coriolis force. We produce temporal power spectra for KOI-54 that are semi-quantitatively consistent with the observations. Both stars in the KOI-54 system are expected to be rotating pseudo-synchronously, with resonant non-axisymmetric modes providing a key contribution to the total torque; such resonances present a possible explanation for the two largest-amplitude harmonic pulsations observed in KOI-54, although we find problems with this interpretation. We show in detail that the non-harmonic pulsations observed in KOI-54 can be explained by non-linear three-mode coupling. The methods developed in this paper can be generalized in the future to determine the best-fitting stellar parameters given pulsation data. We also derive an analytic model of KOI-54’s ellipsoidal variability, including both tidal distortion and stellar irradiation, which can be used to model other similar systems.},
